Thank you NYT, for shedding light on modern-day slavery.
 This almost makes up for the "Saudi-Led" subterfuge. I noticed all the media seem to have bought into this Saudi-Led nonsense. What country is a "Saudi-Led"? Do bombers get to escape blame by not being identified? What national flag was on the planes that massacred all these civilians? I guess we will never know.

What about the actual slavery that goes around in the US and around the world? Young girls and boys are kidnapped from their homes or sold by their families.....why does the NY times not cover this?

Issues we need to be discussing. And we need to ask the Congressional Black Caucus and all of our elected officials if they accept funds from private prison companies and vote out the congressman who accept those funds. Wake up!

China will play ping pong with India's bid for NSG and UN ban of Massod Azhar, as there are multiple reasons, one to please Pakistan for CPEC, secondly Dalai Lama the Noble peace, spiritual leader of Tibet, who lives in exile in India,China considers Dalai Lama as terrorist, but cant designate him to UN mandate terrorist, which will be vetoed by other UN permanent members. More over there is an exile government of Tibet being setup in Dharmashala, India, which irritates China.

I like her view on the word Diversity. But, I like to add that from my experience ( from a HR perspective) that the words Diversity and Inclusion are used in one sentence. I think Inclusion would work by it self!

if you agree to working for a set amount of hours and salary, it is not slavery :)

This documentary should be mandatory viewing for all, highly recommend it

So a documentary, not a fictional retelling of an important historic event like Selma....I prefer history to fictional retellings of it..

until mid of the 19th century, almost the whole of the European population were slaves due to the feudalistic system - and they have overcome

we learned hard lessons over the last few years..first is we cant trust EXPERTS who are paid by the rich or political parties to spin whats happening ....WMDs FREE TRADE 2008 housing collapse...experts had free rein to do as they liked and it HURT ordinary Americans. The Media is telling us that CLINTON is the only choice yet she represents the very interests that sent our jobs to ASIA and allowed BANKSTERS to bankrupt us...TRUMP sounds more like the right one for the White HOuse someone who willl change the GAME for us.

"There is a class of colored people who make a business of keeping the troubles, the wrongs, and the hardships of the Negro race before the public. Having learned that they are able to make a living out of their troubles, they have grown into the settled habit of advertising their wrongs - partly because they want sympathy and partly because it pays. Some of the these people do not want the Negro to lose his grievances, because they do not want to lose their jobs."

--- Booker T. Washington (who died in NINETEEN HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN!!!)

And so it goes.

Black slavery used as propaganda
