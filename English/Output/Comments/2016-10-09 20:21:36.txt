They need to turn off his microphone while she's speaking.  He's obviously not mature enough to understand social expectations and has no respect for women.

enough of this who is better them who . I have a question what will you do to make the hard working middle class able to afford to stay in the US . How will you keep jobs with benefits . how will you keep the cost of healthcare down.

Yes, she has been in serving the people of US for 30 years...it takes time to make change happen...you think you can go in and order a change and everyone is going to bow to you and follow orders...it's not a dictatorship position you are running for...you are running to be a president of the greatest democratic country in the world!

What kind of weapon would the candidates be? I feel like Trump is something blunt and ineffective like a hammer that nails from the handle while Clinton is something that may or may not kill you depending upon what she says at the time.
I'm just sick that I can say these things with a straight face.

It's not that he doesn't understand certain question...he chooses not to understand some questions...he is used to doing whatever he wants...NOT ANYMORE!

Draw a picture of a child-- Trump-- having yet another tantrum.

Hate listening to this man...please turn off his microphone when someone else is talking...

Wouldn't surprise me if Donald gave Hillary bunny ears while standing behind her when she's talking.

Donald Trump totally won the debate!  His Lincoln remarks and the jail remark were classic!  Huge win!  He was fighting three against one and kicked Hillary's butt!  Martha actually argued with him!!!!  Martha was not supposed to be debating Trump, Hillary was.  TRUMP HIT IT OUT OF THE PARK!

Love it.
