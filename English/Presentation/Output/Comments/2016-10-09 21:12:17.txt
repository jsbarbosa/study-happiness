Trump is a man with a vision for America, not a specific vision, a great vision...the best vision...Trump has a plan to make this country great again....What plan??....a great plan...a plan that will work because it's the best plan.....Why???... because Trump knows good people...which people???....the best people....people that are not stupid like other people....people who know how to get deals done...what deals???...great deals...the biggest deals... because I know words... What words???...I have the best words... I get my information from watching TV... I consult with myself because I have a great brain... A great brain???...the best brain...Trump will also build a big wall to keep Mexicans out and he will make Mexico pay for it!...How....??? its all part of the great plan!...ISIS will be gone very, very quickly...How???... I won't tell you.. It's a secret !!!... (This guy is a “one-man circle jerk” and he is only about entertaining the uneducated who love him and his great plan. He's all air - no substance. And he is their “Champion”.)

We should forget that these debates are about picking our next President. Who has the best grasp of the issues that real issues that effect America and ordinary Americans? Hillary Clinton has had a long and substantive career in public service. In contrast, so far Donald Trump has not made the case that he is anything more than a bombastic narcissistic demagogue.

She is so going to be president! And you know what? I think she is going to be great! I never thought I would say this , because I am a Bernie supporter, but she is killing it in this debate! The gap between them has NEVER been this wide! Yay  for women!!!

Trump running for President the biggest human fail of all time. What a mistake this was for him. Hillary schooling him like a teacher and talking down to him like a child. Too sad to look at anymore.

Wow, just saw Clinton taking notes (!) while the moderator was repeating her question. And I note Trump isn't answering the question - again.

Trump is playing to his base which doesn't read. He's vomiting at the choir. There are not enough of them for him to win. This is an exercise in futility.

Hillary did support the war as a Senator and Trump was just a citizen with an opinion that has no legislative power. Come NYT you know be better!!

As an Australian can I ask if this whole 'trump for president' thing just a massive prank the US is playing on the world? If so, can you please stop now, it's getting scary to think someone so stupid, arogant and orange could have so much power

Trump is derailing this campaign all by himself... He has nobody to blame but him... He has done nothing but help the Clinton Campaign..

Who cares he had zero influence in making it happen. He certainly didn't have access to the same government information!  He was a private citizen!!!!!  Deflect much!!

Trump is acting Trump lying and making unsubstantiated accusations and more importantly has no solid plans

Why Mrs. Clinton did not emphasise the great role played by the Iraqi volunteer fighters against ISIS??? She talked about the liberation of Mosul without mentioned 'em. Just to inform you, before Mosul, there were many cities occupied by ISIS such as Ramadi, Tikrit, Diala ,...ecc. Thanks to the Iraqi volunteer fighters, those cities are completely free now.

fact checking Trump is superfluous. Deplorables are not driven by fact or reason and those on the other side already know them

So can someone please tell me why it's a big deal if Trump supported the war or not. She's the one who had classified info and Intel and still voted for it. He was just a business man who did not have the info she did. Seriously someone please tell me.

Also evidence she supported and continues to support it. Trump was asked a question on Howard Sterns radio show when he was a citizen not a politician. She was in office. Big difference. Hillary's judgement is flawed. Can't seem to tell the truth even if someone tells her. Not trustworthy.

Just FYI, I've seen video footage of Hillary laughing about getting the guy that raped a 12 year old girl off with a slap on the wrist. If that "fact check" is wrong then how many others are as well. This is a totally one sided post and it's ridiculous.

Donald Trump is brilliant! Way to go all the way to winning debate #2! One month from today we all will be different on the road for the better and Trump will be president-elect! TRUMP 2016!

I think the point of it is Donald Trump was not in the Senate or the House at that time. Trump beat her and the moderators straight up in this debate.

In most other western countries obviously lying in an open debate would disqualify any candidate to any public postion there is. How come this is so widly tolerated in the US? And how is it legitimate to use personal attacks in a professional debate? What Mrs. Clinton's husband does and has done has absolutley nothing to do with her ability to work as president of the United States. Please stage proper debates with proper contents. And please don't vote for Trump!

She is a fighter and never give up!!  
The only sentences on the whole debate that he says that was true and the only question that he knew how to answer without show his ignorance😂😂 the guy is a idiot🙈

Am sure the comments will soon get nasty. So I just want to say something positive. I hope whomever reads this that you have a great week!

Listening to Donald Trump speak is like being in a stall in a public washroom when someone enters the adjacent stall and has explosive diarrhea.

Hey @nytimes -- You claimed to fact check the 2nd debate... yet you fact checked 22 Trump statements and only 5 Clinton statements... does Hillary not believe in using facts?

After the Saudis attacked us on 9/11, then-Senator Clinton addressed Congress and claimed that Saddam Hussein had ties to Al Qaeda. So we went to war with Saudi Arabia's longtime enemy, Iraq. We fought a war on behalf of the nation that attacked us.

Starting to think Trump and Hillary actually have some kind of alliance and he's been paid a few hundred million to Just make her look like a decent candidate when in reality she all but is it.

There was also evidence in the deleted emails and Benghazi, but 🙊 oops, I forgot...there is a double standard for the Clintons.

what was the result of his support?... Did it register pn C-span... because I recall republivans yea or Nea... I recall Dems Yea or Nea...I recall one Independent yea or Nea... but I don't recall any place in the House or Senate debate or vote where Donald Trump's position helped determine if we went to war with Iraq...

Trump never answered a question with sound and clear argument. He demonstrated again lack of control, he acted like an animal in a cage. And Hillary? She does not quits. Hillary 100%

Why do we, Polish people have still visas to the US? We are not criminals. 
All presidents promised us to lift the visas with no result. Why is America scared of Poles. ?

Liberal Media get off the money and power hungry Hillary wagon (The Bonnie and Clyde of Politics) and join the Trump Train. STOP CORRUPTION IN WASHINGTON DC VOTE TRUMP/PENCE. Trump all the way! He cares more for this country then that other person!

Comes down to career politician who says anything public or private to a career businessman who is trying something different.

TBH, his statement was literally "Eh...I guess so"

Holding him accountable for that off-the-cuff remark is pretty ridiculous.

This is a lie.  I have seen your evidence.  In an interview he responded mostly non-commitally, he deflected as he stated he did not have enough information and at the time everyone was in shock from 911.  In an interview a little later once he had more information he stated quite clearly he was against it.  Why don't you liberals use the same standard for HRC with her statements on TPP, Bill's rape accusations, and her tax stances.

If you think the Times fact-checking is biased check out the other sites such as Politifacts....or have you just decided that everyone is persecuting poor Donald?

Hillary Clinton raised Michelle Obama as to a conceit about going-higher (I always thought the G-d-don't-make-no-junk line from Obama's memoir was more poignant, akin to Mistah-Kurz-he-dead, though 'Heart Of Darkness' as superficially treated in the memoir)...but then Clinton said that 'bullying is up' (up as higher...and go-higher as 
counselled...so go-bully as the messaging?)

Clinton wants to be president even if people don't vote for her...people not voting for her as irrelevant...she wants to be president even without people voting for her?

Hillary Clinton's silly attempt to invoke (though unnamed) 'discourse' and then Cooper's coded-talk about 'discipline' suggests a Foucaultian swerve...seemingly feted by LGBT as that he's THEIR guy, or some such (corruption, in other words, such cultural, Shaftebury-esque flourishes - a Whig agenda about 'self-regulation,' ironically...the GOP as the American offshoot of Whigs.)

Oscar Wilde and Bunburying...Shaftesburying?

Hillary Clinton mentioned powers (presidential power related to the veto), but she also alluded to Giuliani (a 911 love-in)...and Clinton mentioned some harmed by rushing towards 'danger' (something about women, too, as maybe a bit uncomfortable)...Austen-Danger-Powers as springs-to-mind...Giuliani undermined line-item veto, though - something Clinton leaves-out....

Whereas the off-putting aspects of Powers reminds one of Trump...he proved more durable....

Trump saying Clinton doesn't know who the rebels are (not a comment on the specifics of that claim, but....)  Trump as Darth Vader to Clinton as Leia...: you-are-PART-of-the-REBEL-alliance...and-are-a-traitor...TAKE-her-away!!

(Though the Scottish accent of Prowse was dubbed-over by James Earl Jones...with Cooper and CNN...to dub-over Trump's Scottish bluster with James Earl Jones...like a CNN audio-hologram...like Michael Jackson posthumous moonwalking?)

Hillary Clinton would try to CLAIM that they're not at-war with Islam, but, rather...it seems that they ARE at-war with Islam, but, that they don't want to be TAGGED for that, and would instead try to 'Bantustan' Islam into an antidisestablishmentarian mode conducive to the Neocon driven war.

The animus of that war against Islam seems to be a race-war -- hence, why racial-profiling surfaced with that war being heightened.

NOW Clinton and Trump would try to wedge Muslims and have some inform on others, having them racially-profile each other, furthering such racial-profiling for the apartheid Neocon aims.

(Trump doesn't seem to realize that 'Honest Abe' was a sarcastic sobriquet - Lincoln as MUCH like Clinton in terms of mendacity - Trump's statements are hardly mendacious as transparent hyperbole (in-general-terms) though THAT statement as didn't seem hyperbole as meant but that Trump BELIEVES that.)

Talk about defeating ISIS sounds like pledges as to invading Iraq (they'd-defeat-ISIS they'd claim...they'll-be-greeted-as-liberators they claimed) - ISIS seems like a predictable counterweight to the Neocons.

Why is Alec Baldwin sparring with a Ghostbuster?

Is that ECTOplasm on her -- as she's an ectomorph Ghostbuster (than the Gilmore-Girl Ghostbuster as more an endomorph - with endoplasm on her?)

Recent new-old comments by Trump (Tel Aviv and Altneuland...oxymoronic...like a public and private position) seem a sideshow distraction, and here might be a gedanken experiment proof of as-much:

Can one imagine someone as sitting on the fence as to whether to support Trump or Clinton, hearing Trump's tape, and then concluding from THAT to support Trump?!

Well...no...not likely....

So why is it otherwise that one might think someone might be on the fence, hearing that, and from THAT deciding how to vote?!

RATHER...it seems the case that those against Trump are still against him, and those for him are still for him - it's irrelevant, in other words....

Meanwhile...one might think that McCain's disavowal proceeds from that McCain's just jealous?

McCain can't grab anything, like Bob Dole, whose arm is busted, he must just say easy-boy while watching Pepsi-Spears, instead.

For all the hits that Trump is taking...it's not like that Bob Dole fought and lost an arm to then watch Tammy Duckworth videos...though Hillary Clinton's special friend from the DNC felt more telethon recalling than 'Born On The Fourth Of July,' or with Christopher Reeve...there-is-no-spoon (Keanu Reeves) as might lift that sad-sack (Sad Keanu meme) into eating her cookie ('The Matrix' - stand-BACK...while-I-eat-a-potato-chip!! - 'The Other Side of the Mountain' (movie-of-the-week)) and feeling right-as-rain ('The Matrix' - 'Matrix' as an earlier Carrie-Anne Moss item - she from Canada, like Celine, as Hillary's former theme-maker...they ARE going to debate in Las Vegas...hmm...maybe more Jerry-Lewis-telethon-esque Hillary-munchkin-cameos...(than with Dorothy))...Mario Cuomo as talking about FDR leaving his wheelchair to lift the country from its knees....

DT opinions are based on gossip, not intelligence

He lies even with video proof. He's a real special kind of scary.

Hillary wants a Medicare Buy-in for ages 55-64?? She has my vote!!

Neandertrump will fight first a nuclear war and hen go back to throwing rocks

Fight 🔥 with 🔥 tonight TRUMP!!! The Clintons both have done far worse!!!! Far worse!

Why does he lie about such blatantly obvious things that can be checked easily? I don't get it.

Trump said what do we have to lose if we elect him? The one and only answer is 'everything'.

I'm counting how many times he has used the word, "disaster".

blah,...blah,...blah.....one huge difference,...he didn't vote for it....she did....oh,..you guys are so desperate....hahaha...

Aka one interview where he said, "I guess so, maybe" vs numerous videos where he clearly does not. Once again, NYT is a joke.

And she went to bed while the ambassador burned. There is evidence.

But he didn't vote for it.... Lol 😂😂😂😂 you guys are unbelievably

Right on!! Trump's plan is the kook-aid his followers are drinking. And he sniffs when he lies folks! Go Hillary!! You go girl!!

hillary will screw the american people and be so corrupt it will never be the same again for america

Except you don't bring up the Neil Cavuto interview right before the Iraq War. Nor do you mention that Mr. Trump was against Iraq WAAAAAY before Mrs. Clinton was—AND SHE WAS A SENATOR, NOT A PRIVATE CITIZEN. 

SHE. VOTED. FOR. THE. WAR. With CLASSIFIED information which told the TRUTH.

Congratulations, New York Pravda. You're nothing more than the washed-up propaganda mouthpiece of the elites like globalist Carlos Slim.

NYT get another Editor or all of you will be out of the job by February.....

No way Trump can have more than 30% of votes.... even McCain doesent support him anymore...

What's with the empty chair in question asking audience? Who, left and why?

But it was Hillary voted for the Iraq War, yet Trump didn't.

Is anyone really surprised he lied,his way through this debate?

Just say that you are on full speed to elect her...

Trump didn't get confidential, high valued intelligence

What about the audios that shows Hillay laughing of a women that was rape when she was lawyer of the deffendant?

They should have brought Jerry Springer in the debate.

The only thing political, I'll be watching from my SLP home's gonna be the election returns!!!!

It was checked last debate, and it was as true then as it is today

He was not. Political figure at that time who was privy to what Hillary knew.

Wish the moderators would take control instead of letting chaos rule.

Thank you for putting together a document that is easy to read and follow.

UNTRUE... THERE IS RECORDED TAPE OF HER LAUGHING AT HOW SHE GOT THE RAPIST OFF!  HER JOB YES.... BUT SHE DID LAUGH AND JOKE ABOUT IT!

Let's face it though Trump doesn't care about factual inaccuracy (or integrity)

Don't care nany , We just overcame & passed it . 
Batool Abbas قلبها علينا

Hillary got smacked down, in the 2nd round, and bill was shamed, when Trump turned the Game.

great job fact checking-- maybe you should look into where the 30,000 emails went, along with Hillary's federal subpoena!

that little fact check wasn't one sided at all. even when trump was dead right, it says, "mostly true". get real.

Trump was a private citizen as same as us at that time and he couldn't vote YES nor NO in The House !

His was an off the cuff comment which he reversed before it began. She voted for it as a congressman.

I hope Trump remembers that he can't save his own house by trying to set other people's houses on fire
Get Trump Nope T-Shirt : https://goo.gl/XrTTDL

fu yellow crap paper, which is going to lose even more money after this quarter...Lol

And yet he keeps denying it and the tape of him being for it. Over and over, like that will change it.

Trump doesn't know the answers.

There is a reason Hillary Clinton is winning so big in New York.

Martha Raddatz: "Mr. Trump, what would you do about Aleppo?"
Donald Trump: "We need more nukes."

The liars fact checking for the liar. Haha!

http://chrispiascik.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/1964-20150901-RonaldMcTrump.png

You can't fact-check nonsense

Making a passing comment on Howard Stern's radio show doesn't constitute a vote to declare war!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

What's to fact check...he keeps repeating the same lies as in the first debate.

No that is incorrect she was against it! They had to convince her to vote for it! Wrong!

Evidence doesn't matter to Trump supporters.

Who even cares? He was a private citizen...can we talk about the future?

Scarlett Quenette - are you simultaneously following the fact- checking?

What about Hillary supporting the war based on lies.. I mean the Iraq war.. That is cool .. Right... Stupid sheeple

Can you please confirm if flies are attracted to 💩 & Demons?? Cause I'm pretty sure the one that landed on her face is evidence of it being TRUE.

As New York senator, Hillary voted to free Dubya's hands in the pursuit of those who attacked the United States on 9/11. No one knew he'd abuse the authority into settling his daddy issues in Iraq.

Fact checking from the organization that leaked the video against one of the candidates...hmmm.

Public faces on policies not the only worry to voters...we have accepted EXPERT opinion as gospel to often over 25 years and it only benefits 1%ers...1%ers who rig the system and depend on politicians like Obama Clinton Bush to distract voters from how the system COULD work for everyone...we have the tools to plan and implement risk management across many fields finance science medicine epidemilogy climate change manufacturing BUT those making the decisions choose who benefits.TRUMP is making the case for average AMericans using knowledge of 1%ers.

-Hillary deleted 10 000 top secret email to avoid 50 years jail term!
-There is evidence!

Trump is sniffing again.

A 'Scottish' moment (Trump as part Scottish - NYTimes would reduce him to a Sturmbahnfuhrer nationality - they sorta tried to do that)...Robert Burns as to the poem about the woman not taking notice of, well...there was that FLY on Hillary Clinton....

Donald Trump totally won the debate!  His Lincoln remarks and the jail remark were classic!  Huge win!  He was fighting three against one and kicked Hillary's butt!  Martha actually argued with him!!!!  Martha was not supposed to be debating Trump, Hillary was.  TRUMP HIT IT OUT OF THE PARK!

I was reading your team's live analysis and I'm stunned by their impressions. To say that Trump was holding his own, coming off better than in the other debates, getting in 'good lines,' etc?  He looked like a petulant, ill-informed child who was determined to avoid the questions. It's an embarrassment that she even has to share a stage with him.

It doesn't matter, he wasn't in politics at that time..

Goooo Hillary!

which candidate voted for the war?

Catch him on the TPP thing, please.

Of course there is.

She also lied about the emails

Team "I can't believe this is happening "

So what? He was a civilian then. Senator Hillary VOED FOR the Iraqi war. Big  difference between for, and voted for.

That said, Gary Johnson 2016

Nyt pay your taxes!!

gee, what are we going to do when this is over.  lol

So did Donald Trump👎

Of course, we all know this.

Hey Times, why are you fact-checking Trump's below-the-belt attacks on Bill Clinton's indiscretions?  Bill is not running for President; Hillary is. When the NY Times sees fit to fact check his sleazy attacks that are not pertinent to this election, you're validating them. Make them INvalid by ignoring them. Don't reprint his garbage.

The Moderators and Hillary vs. Trump.

It's true.

Doesn't matter. He was not in public office.

I guess so, isn't supporting....

She will sign TPP.

There's audio

Those pesky facts!!  Lol

She voted for it!

Yeah I'll believe fact-checking from the NY Times.

Are you fact checking both candidates?

Where's the fact check on the endorsement by 'hundreds of generals'?  And the AZ boarder patrol officers?  Fact or fiction????

Stop wasting your time NYT.  Your not going to sway a single vote to Hillary because anyone with half a brain knows you're in the bag for her.  Fact checking....LMAO!!
