I am not surprised that Trump supporters think that interrupting non-stop, turning red, sniffing, not answering questions, and deflecting equal winning a presidential debate. After all, Trump supporters are the reason why shampoos still come with directions.

PLOT TWIST: at the end of this election, Trump is going to publicly say he wasn't actually running for president and it was a social experiment to see how far people would go to defend such idiotic remarks.

To be fair, this video fact checks many more of Trump's claims than Clinton's (9 of trump, 1 of clinton). I am not defending Trump and his misogynistic, rude, insensitive comments, and bogus claims but I do think it would be more effective if we held both candidates to the same standards. Plus it would be better for clinton if we saw how much more truth is in her words.

Actually, there are bus loads of male Syrians coming across the Mexican border through Arizona. Men only. No women or children. Maybe you need to come to the border and do some additional fact checking????

I have never heard such ignorance from any previous candidate as was evident from Mr Trump. He lack basic politeness  not to mention statesmanship. To refer to his opponent in the third person singular whilst that person is present is ignorance of the highest degree. He showed no understanding of foreign policy and most probably does not even know where Syria is. This is a dangerous man and would be an embarrassment to the entire body politic.

Donald Trump thinks "when you're a star" you "can do anything" to women? Well you can't make us vote for you, you misogynistic entitled pig.

There is no denying that Trump comes out with lies, inaccurate statements, or things that are plain false and yet his supporters STILL think he's a viable candidate to run the country for at least 5 years! He refuses to release his tax statements because he knows that he'll be caught red handed committing tax fraud! 

Why can't his supporters, like the rest of America and the rest of the world wake up, smell the hypocrisy and change their minds to vote for the candidate who actually wants to help people!

I am not for either of these candidates, but if you are going to do fact checks, then do it right without biased opinionated commentary. This story demonstrates why so many Americans do not trust the media anymore, and justifies the Trump supporters claims that the media is openly biased to Clinton. Media is to be the truth holder for the general public. It would be nice if they did that for once

the fact chek is biased. Syrian army liberated Palmyra under Russian aircover. USA watched it get destroyed by ISIS while flying over them with F-16's. I bet you didn't even know Palmyra is liberated because ISIS advances get more media coverage than their defeat.

Trump was great. This election is about stopping the violence and hate. Hillary will be more of the same. Trump will make America GREAT again. We need that. She is a pretender- Trump is a president.

For that Q&A portion, Trump addressed his voting constituents viewing at home and flat out ignored the very question the hijab-wearing Muslim lady asked... come to think of it, he practically overlooked all of them like chess pieces whereas Hillary politely engaged with all of them... Hillary passes the eye test in that regard.

I believe he is part of a bigger scheme. I have said it all along. He is giving his worst so he can be kicked out and the Repubs will replace him with their pick. It started with Megan kelly acting offended....and the beat goes on. Paranoia?  Maybe!

Maybe Donald Trump should go to Syria stay with troops for a few days and actually see what is going on, instead of going home to Trump Tower and pretend to care about and give lip surface to "We the People" that he even cares about anything but the title and power.

You guys are joke. Trump owned her.  He literally destroyed Killary.  Honestly New York times, you are not an independent media.

He said two or three times he had paid hundreds of millions of dollars in taxes. Since we have no access to his tax returns, we can't fact check that.

I was raised to never trust a liar, and because Hillary said;

Its just allergies.
Its just cough.
I got over heated.
I tripped.
I have a cold.
I have the flu.
I have pneumonia.

I don't have a server at home
I didn't use my server at home.
I didn't send or receive emails from my phone.
I didn't delete any emails.
I didn't know C stood for confidential.

I don't trust her.

While I believe that all you have printed here is true-why is it so one sided? Is everything she said true? Is that even possible? I'm no Trump fan but the bias in all forms of media in this election is epic. What happened to a little impartiality? Why not be more even on both candidates. This is shameful.

Trump is so uninformed about so many things how could you expect him to provide correct answers to any question. Plus he is sniffling like is has been snorting coccaine.

Islamic radicals have long set a goal to destroy the United States. The main purpose of their attacks on US financial and banking sector. With the help of terrorist attacks and military conflict in Syria has a goal to give up the use of the US dollar in world trade.

let's see so trump only got 1 fact right out of 10 so that's 10% accuracy rate which is a very scary thought!!! He should go back to what he is good at....sexually harassing/assaulting women!

They are both concentrated evil in a meat sack. 
Hillary are supporters calling trump supporters morons.  Yet both supporting evil criminals. 
Its just a matter of choosing the evil criminal that offends you less? 
If you are voting for one of the two major parties you are ALL morons.

You should check and find out if the man is on drugs illegal drugs like cocaine which some people are saying because he sniffing so much

Can't they just cancel the whole thing and start again - with new candidates people who might just be great leaders - just get rid of these clowns - - for the first time in my life I feel sorry for the American people!

Suggesting that Russia is not interested in neutralising ISIS has completely devalued this fact check. The only way to permanently defeat not just ISIS but any other terrorist organisation and stop the migrant flow as well, is to bring stability to the region - even if it means the outcome isn't favourable to western interests

Honestly I think hillary wont beat him, instead Donald beat himself he will lose becuz hes been shooting himself in the foot since day one.

Yet they didn't talk about what affects average Americans. Healthcare barely got any air time nor did any foreign policy that would get our troops out of the ME for good. Obama has made a mess of Syria.

Mr. Trump, this isn't a reality TV show. It's a presidential debate. You are showing once again that you are temperamentally unfit for the office. https://goo.gl/XrTTDL

At that point , when you see that the both are stupid, selfish and not even competent , is it possible to choose other candidates ? Cause this is not a debate , this is a reality tv show.. It's all about 'buzz' . Friendly .

So the NYT puts this little clip together to show us they fact check. That's great except they only fact check DT and HRC on one issue üôÄüôÄ liberal media bias much???

Family Clinton were already in power, so I think Trump should be next President ... to give chance for peace ... 

Clintons are so much war-like

"Mr. Trump said Syria, Russia and Iran are fighting the Islamic State.

Mostly misleading."

"Syria and Russia have carried out airstrikes against some Islamic State militants, but the majority of their military action has been conducted against other more moderate rebels."

So how is that "mostly misleading" if all three of those nations have been involved at some point in fighting and pushing back IS forces? It would ONLY be misleading if he had said that Russia/Syria/Iran were ONLY fighting the Islamic State. But he didnt. So what he said is factual.

Only fact check for trump not for Hillary. I wonder how much Hillary paid this media channel. I am not taking sides but just trying to be fair

oh Lord...NYT is doing a late night 'fact-check'...
the last one was trashed...but if you're drunk then you can "check" lots of things... (sorry, locker room talk)

DT won. He was more effective because of his short sentences and use of keywords.
HC told people to go to her site, during a debate meant for explaining yourself.
DT is becoming smarter with his talking points and that's a problem for HC

He states nothing of any substance. He deflects to mask his lack of knowledge. I cannot stand either of them but at least Clinton understands what's going on in the world. 
You'd get a better answer, more knowledgeable answer, from a brick wall  instead of Trump.

The media's fact check is one side wishful, biased information with a secret purpose of brainwashing those who can't check facts themselves.

Mark Grinko Eric Brinzenskiy mad funny how this is a trump and hillary fact check but hillary is only shown once. #Media

Michael Dindia, Sandra Maria, Robert Jr Ziehm... here's ur answer to all those plans lol. That u thought were true lol

People "coming in from Syria" and "people coming in to the US from Syria" are two different things. Go check why an american ambassador died while trying to retrieve weapons that shouldn't have been there, it may be tough because there are 33,000 email missing.

Trump savaged her.
She looked more bewildered than Bill.

I watched this without audio, and they look like theyre doing a rap battle

Can you say -- We love Hillary any louder. I don't think that there is any doubt who the NYT 's supports.

Women will grab this liar by his p*ssy on November 8, 2016, BELIEVE US! üíãüá∫üá∏üíÉüèª

If Trump believes as a "star," he can do anything to women, what will he think he can do to us as President?

Trump supporters are unpersuaded by facts, so this is futile.

Unfortunately those who need the fact checker don't care about them, and still support the bloke!!!!

Fact checker you liedüòÇ
According to those responsible for destroying those 33k emails; they did so after being instructed by Clinton. This came out in a congressional hearing. For you fact checkers to pretend it was a mistake on the part of techies is dirty bizniz

Who in the hell uses hammers and bleachbit to destroy subpoenaed public records? 

Someone unfit to be POTUS

Trump doesnt even know his key economic policy, i.e. his tax cut, you bet he hasnt find a way to pay for it either.

Donald Trump won the right to be president...of a locker room.

Lots of lies and half lies from Trump and one true. No trues for Hillary? I know she was factually correct in many things.

He's a liar and a rapist who has a pedophile rape hearing in December.

what use is a fact check from a biased source?  you criticize everything trump does...you would probably get more truth from north korean propaganda

IF NEW YORK TIMES IS ENDORSING TRUMP - THEN MY FELLOW AMERICANS TIME TO "DUMP TIMES WITH TRUMP"

Joy Lokey, this is your vote? He's wildly misinformed on more than one fact.

Too bad Trump doesn't get the facts before he shouts.

Truth will set me free trump your already fail Hillary Clinton go ahead new president of united state of america god bless you amen...

I hope Trump remembers that he can't save his own house by trying to set other people's houses on fire
Get Trump Nope T-Shirt : https://goo.gl/XrTTDL

The successful candidate jailing the runner-up is one of the chief signs of a healthy democracy.. lol

Stop acting like facts and truth matter to Trump. It's getting tiresome.

As for who won, I have no idea, but I do know America lost.

You don't have to choose between Bill's principal enabler and Trump. Vote Gary Johnson. 

BTW before you mention Aleppo read below. 
Hillary,"we were under sniper fire"

Hillary,"we left the Whitehouse dead broke"

Hillary,"I was instrumental in the Irish peace process"

Hillary,"A hateful video caused Benghazi"

Hillary replied ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know‚Äù a whopping 327 TIMES during her e-mail investigation. After SMASHING 13 iPads and iPhones!

Hillary," We all knew he was guilty as hell *laughs*" -when talking about a child molester she defended and won for 

Hillary, ‚Äúfloozy,‚Äù ‚Äúbimbo‚Äù and ‚Äústalker,‚Äùeffort to cast doubt on the Bill's accusers. 

Wolff: ‚ÄúAnd Brexit? Your position?‚Äù Trump: ‚ÄúHuh?‚Äù 
Wolff: ‚ÄúBrexit.‚Äù 
Trump: ‚ÄúHmm.‚Äù 
Wolff: ‚ÄúThe Brits leaving the EU.‚Äù 

Trump,"I remember watching the firefighters on 7/11"

Trump,"I will defend article 11 of the constitution!"

Trump,"I don't know why there are 13 stripes on the flag"

Trump thought Quds=Kurds

Trump,"I don't think my daughter Ivanka would pose for playboy, although she does have a very nice figure, I've said if Ivanka weren't my daughter perhaps I'd be dating her"

Trump about a married woman:"Yeah, that‚Äôs her. With the gold. I better use some Tic Tacs just in case I start kissing her. You know, I‚Äôm automatically attracted to beautiful ‚Äî I just start kissing them. It‚Äôs like a magnet. Just kiss. I don‚Äôt even wait. And when you‚Äôre a star, they let you do it. You can do anything." 
"Grab ‚Äôem by the p***y. You can do anything."

Trump like a raging bull... trying to intimidate because he has nothing else to give. He is nothing else than a clown.

HILLARY DIDN'T EVEN WEAR AN AMERICAN FLAG PIN .....VOTING REPUBLICAN THIS TIME

Hilary's medical condition was affection her scripted responses . Hillary husband is the white Bill Cosby and she is a murder , thief and compulsive liar . She is on fit for a coffin of jail

I so, so wish Hillary is up against a better and brighter non-moronic opponent.

A path to citizenship for illegal immigrants sounds like amnesty to me.

Fact check against the fact check: That's total nonsense. Refugees do not go through a rigorous vetting process. If you disagree, describe the vetting process in detail. Please be specific. .

This refugee need to ask who fault is this..im a muslim I dont even know what to do ...

Moderate rebel, eh? Stopped watching after that. NYT needs fact checks.

Wouldn't call it a debate. It was more a circus with the American people being the losers.

Questi due contendenti sono entrambi poca cosa rispetto al compito da svolgere quale Presidente della pi√π grande potenza del pianeta, ahinoi. :(

What an oxymoron " fact checking from a severely slanted source"!

State Islamic terror persecuted the Jews and your blood will be rivers ...

Um vai ter coragem ter detonar!!!!! o outra vai levar flores e cafezinho porque perdoa chifre n√£o existe! Traiu sai fora!

It looks like NYT pays more attention to checking Trump mistakes than Clinton's : just sayin ;) Looks like Clinton won the game here !

This is why NYT will be bankrupt soon they only report lies not the truth.

Shush! NY times you are so annoying shut up! you are so biased and bought out! BOUGHT OUT BY HILLARY!

Fact checks !?
You must be jocking NYT !?!
There never were "moderate rebels" !!!
These Al-Nusrah/Al-Qaeda people are all CIA/Pentagon-trained and funded ! They fight innocent civilians to serve an illegal US-led partition of Syria in the interest of Israel, the US and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia - aka the three countries which have most benefited from 9/11 !

Murray Rosenfeld seems your candidate is allergic to the truth...hahahahaha

he may be a second-hand car dealer, but he's brave and strong

After that is a third debate really needed?...

Fact the NYT does not pay taxes. http://www.breitbart.com/big-journalism/2016/10/02/new-york-times-paid-no-taxes-2014/

Why isn't there a fact check about his statement that "Russia is new to nuclear?" The New York Times

Most of this 'fact checking' was incorrect. Let's allow the media outlets like CNN to make up our minds (sarcasm)

The Fact check is great but the ineterpretation by The New York Times is way off base redendering the fact check moot.

Alexia. To be fair, I don't think they fact checked them equally. This is why people then complain about the media too....

dear New York Times get your infos right. In many of his answers he is actually saying the true

They are scared to lose so much :) Yes Klinton is for you ;)

Dump trump

Check on Benghazy 
The Iran deal

You may want to fact check your fact checkers because the leaked  emails state she tells rich Holman sacks elite she wants open borders and open trade.  Smh liberal bias is going down.

Dump the Trash Trump

I believe in Trump. HILLARY-OUS IS A LIAR.

omg he knows nothing abt history and facts lol

President Trump !

I hope all the "children" of the Hillary Clinton supporters are getting  ready for the WW3 draft.  Guaranteed, "Vladimir Putin" is waiting with his fingers on the triggers of the best nuclear weapons earth has on it. No worries Chelsea Clinton will be exempt from her mothers war..  yet all her supporters children will not be nor will any one else on earth after Putin starts launching the best ICBM's money can buy.

Trump   is Mentally ill  and  is so desperate   he will do anything to get voted in  , he is making you Americans  the laughing  stock of the World .  vote him in the gutter where he belongs

I like this presentation of fact checking. Easy to follow. Easy to read. 1) Quote. 2) Fact Check.

well this fact check sure was one sided, go figure!!

Deeply disturbing



Making Fascism fashionable.

Were there any with two inveterate liars?

The NYT wouldn't know "facts" from lies, obviously

Boycott NYT!!! FAT LIARS.

This fact check is so biased. Lmao What a joke.

#letgarydebate

Well that was rather one sided.

Who won? üòÇ

Yet more clown sightings.

They both suck.

As usual, Trump writes up his own "facts"

i just love the music in the background..

Seems like the paper favors the stupid bleached blonde. Really?

Most of your fact checking is wrong, especially about the Syrian refugees and the US vetting process.  New York Times............I have no faith in what you say and don't believe a word of it.

Perhaps his mental health?

Fact check NYT.

Check it out

Check the Clinton Foundation

Islamic State Nonstop 2016 USA !!

Wow. Finally. That is what the media should do....FINALLY

Sound like they already do extreme vetting

Your FACT CHECK is wrong

Let's talk about Hillary being punked.. Now that's a fact Jack

New York slime checking facts . What a joke.

Trump loose, America gone... #VoteForTrump

Benghazi

trump is a game show host.....not ever a president.

She hides her money in her "charity".

Trump won .....

Great information!!

Fact check the bigger liar Clinton.

I do my own fact checks do not want the media to tell me what to believeüëå

This fact check should be fact checked.

NYT fact checking is properganda

Trump pay your tax first

HILLARY'S HITMAN SPILLED THE BEANS

What a joke you are.

nice music

Dumb and Dumber part 3

... "because you'd be in jail" :)

Trump ! now and then , ...

Michael Schwarz "hundreds of thousands" hahahahaha

Next President Of The United States Of America Donald J. Trump

Waco

Nherz, Chuck for next election.

1:44 He says Russia is killing ISIS and Iran is killing ISIS.  So why The New York Times add a text "Syria and Russia's airstrikes" ? And also why only American's media believe that Al Nostra is moderate rebel ?
What a poor level of politics in USA...

Troy Mancuso just cause it's insightful



Please check why Donald and his v.p candidate don't communicate. ..

Never trust a man living in gold house üëå

Check Killary

b n

Aa

I can't believe how stupid some of these comments are! You tell me One business owner that doesn't do what he can to get out of paying the max on his taxes! Trump talks about bettering our country! All Hillary's interested in doing is bettering everyone else's country.   Not to mention infringe on our constitutional rights! Yes! Trumps not perfect, but in the state this country is in right now!  He's  definitely a far better choice than Hillary! Look at their track record... Hillary flip flops!  One minute she wants a wall, next she doesn't. One second she's against gay marriage, now she's ok with it. One minute their are no emails, Whoops! now their are! Notice a trend. Like him or hate him Trump tells it how it is! That's what this country needs right now!

that last one tho Brooke McGowan

Brandi Jeanis fact check time

Sophie Marano educate yourself

Brian Bulakowski watch this.

Hailey Parish-Lapriore lmao watchthis.

Adolfo Ortega Mata mira amor

I'm sure the fatboy is wearing a bulletproof vest. Hillary as well.  "Surreal"

The NYT's SUCKS!!!  We don't care about your sodomite opinions.

Vinita

Freya Schmitz

I'm getting impression if Clinton continue politics of Obama there will  be a war

Dijana Di :D

Hillary did good.   Also,   in the past she was only protecting her marriage on all fronts. üòä

The Swiss Alps is looking really good now.  Maybe even Narnia.
