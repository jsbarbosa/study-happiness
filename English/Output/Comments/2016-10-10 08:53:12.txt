"Boko Haram, referred to by themselves as al-Wilāyat al-Islāmiyya Gharb Afrīqiyyah (Arabic: الولاية الإسلامية غرب أفريقيا‎‎, (Islamic State West Africa Province, ISWAP),[12] and Jamā'at Ahl as-Sunnah lid-Da'wah wa'l-Jihād (Arabic: جماعة أهل السنة للدعوة والجهاد‎‎, "Group of the People of Sunnah for Preaching and Jihad"),[13] is an Islamic extremist group based in northeastern Nigeria, also active in Chad, Niger and northern Cameroon.[7] The group was led by Abubakar Shekau until August 2016, when he was succeeded by Abu Musab al-Barnawi.[1] The group had alleged links to al-Qaeda, but in March 2015, it announced its allegiance to the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL).[14][15] Since the current insurgency started in 2009, it has killed 20,000 and displaced 2.3 million from their homes[16] and was ranked as the world's deadliest terror group by the Global Terrorism Index in 2015.[17][18]"

Yes, I had to google this and yes, I copied and pasted.
Scary thou

Well, yes, that's what religion is -- brainwashing! No duh.

Barack Obama is sitting on his hands while Islamic extremism takes over the planet… while Boko Harum continued to kidnap girls in Barack's native land. Obama has ruined our country. (All this while Hillary Clinton refused to add them to our terrorist list when she was Sec of State.)

Obama has crippled the US economy. Everybody I know is either out of work or under-employed. I haven’t had a raise in years (despite all my expenses increasing from year to year). My health insurance is now up to $400/month. Before the government touched it, it was $170/month! My auto insurance, which the government has yet to ruin, is thankfully only $25/month (from Insurance Panda). Please, Obama! Don’t try to socialize auto insurance!

With everything Obama touched in shambles, Barry needs a new job. The guy needs to step down before he is impeached.

This is the vacuum left by the USA as they cut and run from the world stage… Yes this is the Barack Obama Foreign Policy!

Didn't this end when Michelle Obama wore a yellow ribbon and held a sign saying bring them home??????

in 2015 8 girls aged 12 to 18 walked into a crowed market in Nigeria and blew themselves up. This is serious business and it is Islamic terrorism
