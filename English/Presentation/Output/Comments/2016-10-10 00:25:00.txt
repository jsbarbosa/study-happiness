No, he said he'd put Hillary Clinton in jail, for very specific unethical things she's been accused of that a lot of people still think she's guilty of. That's not dictatorial, that's legal, that's applying the law as he sees it

Just shows the true character of who he is

I was speechless at her calm demeanor. How could she not react violently to such a provocation? But she didn't. She kept relying upon facts while my blood was boiling at this oaf who bears more resemblance to Hussein and Gaddafi every day.

It's not dictator talk when you're talking about someone who is actually a criminal. LOL This propaganda won't work much long NYT. There's a reason why only 6% of people trust the media and this is one of those reasons.

So they're mad because he said he would pursue a federal criminal and hold them accountable to their crimes? Wow. So dictator like. Almost like enforcing the law is being a tyrant.

You guys are desperate. No one believes you anymore. Cages 😂😂😂...only an emoticon can describe that preposterous takeaway from his statement. Clinton is a crook, broke laws and he would throw her in jail after prosecuting her. Pretty straight to me.

A POTUS cannot appoint a 'special' prosecutor. A special prosecutor generally is a lawyer from outside the government appointed by an attorney general or, in the United States, by Congress to investigate a government official for misconduct while in office. I wish someone would ask DT how a law is made, I bet he couldnt answer.

Oh good lord he was talking about her criminal behavior. And you know it but you are a liberal and you have to twist the truth and I think America is sick of it. I know I am.

Actually she would be in jail because she is corrupt and breaks the law. Treasonous to be exact. The New York Times you're a joke and who writes your articles, idiots or morons.

We loved her as senator of NY - don't know what he is talking about- Ghoalani pulled out of the race against her as he had too many lies and baggage that he couldn't find enough to support him

Check your punctuation....Oh... and a "quote" is a quote. He did not say he would put his opponents in cages. He said "you'd be in jail". Specifically to Hillary only.

Wow this is pretty ridiculous The New York Times....

I'm not even a huge fan of trump but you sound like you've been bought by hilary hard.

He didn't say that and to label it as a dictator talk is just plain silly.

Lost a fan

NYT you distort the truth. Your headline is malicious and misleading. Trump was referring to offence Mrs. Clinton might have committed on the unlawfull use emails. We love Donald J Trump!

When he said that, the audience fell into a Jerry Springer/Married With Children noise and the moderators scrambled to keep some semblance of seriousness, to no real end. The spectacle of this bizarre thing continues to its illogical conclusion.

Trump has National Socialists like David Duke. Marxist Socialist dictators like Kim Jong Un and gangster autocrats like Putin. Meanwhile Hillary has the endorsement of every living US President, uniting Conservatives and Liberals against a common enemy of freedom.

He did not say that. NY times is trying to spin his words to make him the bad guy and take the felony charges that Clinton commited. He said she would be in jail. Which if the FBI actually did there job she would already be there

"It is the fact that it’s no longer assured that you automatically lose a presidential debate in which you promise to jail your political rival." That really nailed it. Trump continues to say and do many things that, in a rational society, would render him polling in the single digits. Yet here he is, still, speaking to the world and declaring, "This is what politics in America has become, folks."

Yup, Donald thinks he's running for Emperor. He thinks his delusional word will be law. He dearly wants to be Putin, but we aren't a Republic nor Russia. 
So ludicrous.

"But it wasn't the fact that he threatened to put his political rivals in cages that made my blood run cold. It was the applause that followed." This author is speaking metaphorically when he speaks of cages in this instance. Such as referring to someone in jail as a jail bird. The person you are referring to isn't literally a bird. And his threat, and his continued insistence that he would run this country as if he was a dictator isn't what makes my blood run cold. It's the number of online posts I continue to see that support his scary, predetory, petulant behavior.

Absolutely crying here. There's bias & there's NY Times bias.

If Hillary stopped during the debate, squatted & started taking a dump in front of everyone the NY Times would be saying, "More revelations about Trumps sick sexual fantasies" 😂

Oh, please. Hillary did wrong and people on the lower end of the pay scale went to jail, lost their benefits, and their livelihood for doing less. How does someone in a better paygrade get away with it?  WHY should she get away with it? Because the NYT says so?

absolutely loved it when Hillary said it's a good thing Trump is not over the law in this country, and he said BECAUSE YOU WOULD BE IN JAIL!! Bahahhahhahha I busted out laughing!! I have watched ever single one of the congressional hearings and her butt should be in jail!! She is a liar and evil evil and if anyone of us had lied to the FBI or Congress we would be in Federal Prison right now! Why Is That Witch Running For President

Quoting the article in such a style, that the readers skimming past this on their fb timeline, will think they are reading trumps exact words. Tut tut, shoddy writing fellas, you should know better.

This is a prime example of why I've canceled my New York Times subscription until after the election. Hopefully after this is all over you will return to being a new source.

NYT used the same loopholes (by claiming losses on their taxes)  to avoid paying taxes as Donald Trump.  Now I see why your company is collapsing.  Terrible reporting.

Trump does not understand the basics of politics. The President is part of the Executive Branch. The Judicial Branch sends people to prison. Even if he won, and appointed a prosecutor, he can't send Hillary to jail ... especially not when the FBI will testify on her behalf!

A sailor went to jail, because He just took some pic. Killary have the 33 thousands DELETED emails, Clinton's foundation pay for play, BENGHAZI, etc., etc.,ETC. PLUS.

It isn't dictator talk, idiots. He is referencing the fact that Hillary Clinton BROKE THE LAW at least twice: she put classified information at risk with her personal server AND she deleted 30,000+ emails AFTER they were requested as part of a formal investigation. It is sad that the NYT and people around the country buy into these desperate attempts to put words in Trump's mouth and make up context that doesn't exist. Trump has said enough idiotic things in his life for you to focus on without creating lies from his points that are valid.

Uh-uh, you agitators. Hillary has broken the law in more ways than one. Emails being deleted, pay for play, rigging the Democratic primaries, intimidating rape victims of Bill Clinton. All those acts are more than qualified to have her arrested for at least 3 decades.

That's not what he said at all.  He said he would try to seek imprisonment for some of the things that she's done or been negligent in doing.

I'm not exactly a fan of Trump, but you guys are incredibly and overtly biased...

It must be a hard pill for you NYT koolaid drinkers to see your girl spanked. Trump is merely saying what's been on the back of our minds: corruption and scandal goes uncheck with hilLIARy, from her foundation selling favors allowing foreign interests to gain access to the Federal government, to a crooked AG conferring with the husband of a presidential candidate while she was under FBai investigation, to the obvious pass FBI director had given regarding hilLIARy's mishandling of classfied information. Yeah, I'm angry. Folks like her deserve, as Trump said "to be in jail."

Ok this one I couldn't ignore. Desperate, NYT. That's a reach and a twist and a few hundred miles off of what was said. Trying way too hard

He wants to open more libel laws so that people can sue more. He wants to suppress freedom of press (already moved in that direction). He wants to print more money like Idi Amin wanted to do. He attacks anyone who disagrees with him. He wants to lock up his political opponent. He admires Putin's strength. He says the most disrespectful things about women (at 59 years of age, not when he was a teenager) and claims no one has more respect for women than him. Early in his life, he killed or almost killed several small businesses. He told everyone that his businesses were doing great while they were simultaneously filing for chapter 11 bankruptcy. He thought if Ivanka weren't his daughter, he might date her. And, when his daughter Tiffany was born he said she had beautiful legs like Marla Maples but wasn't sure how she'd turn out in the upper part of her body. Yes, Alt-Right, he's the leader you need. He does not ever lie and would be a great role model for the nation, particularly your children. He'll teach how to treat women well. And he will #MakeAmericaGreatAgain. #TimeToWakeUp.

Do you guys at New york times still have any respect left for your proffession? I mean you may twist facts and tell lies to low brainers but not on issues that have aired publically. Sayinng " i will appoint a special prosecutor to look into your case " is not trying to put political opponents in cages. So instead your supporters of political leader makes huge mistakes and walking away free. Then why was a special prosecutor appointed in the case of Bill clinton leading to his impeachment?

Hillary was correct 'Déplorable tRump's supporters or a basket of déplorables'. Well, now they are more like a Titanic full of déplorables reading their comments here! Hey déplorables, keep talking, you digging the holes for your coffins and your déplorable tRump (we got the hammer and nails and the shovels)!

who bought you off?  wow...obviously did not listen to the debate...guess you are competing for National Enquirer readership...anyone working there should leave their job position with your paper off their resume if they ever desire a respectable career.

She deserves to be in jail. Everyone covered up for her, including the FBI. No one person should be above the law. The mere fact that she deleted so many emails and many files went  after being subpoenaed. If that was any one of us .....we'd be long incarcerated.

listen NY times staff...we would all get fired or arrested at any company in NY if we held work emails or data  on a private server..just the way it is.. financial data for example..federal crimes. so yea we would all be in jail for this type of thing

WOW! Trump is such a creep! How can anyone vote for this guy? He already treats women like animals (or inanimate objects) and now he is adding another group of people to his complete lack of respect. He is a sociopath.

Shame on you USA, what is this hateful debate and how should such psychopaths manage this world other than the abyss. The world looks on with astonishment and can hardly believe what they witnessed

Dear Lord, help usssssss all. Cages?! Why are people so ridiculous?! She should be in jail because she broke the law numerous times. It doesn't take a dictator to think that would be appropriate. The New York Times - you're a joke. #collusion

He never said he would put political opponents in cages. That statement is the authors embellishment, at best.
A president is well within their power to appoint an investigation.
This article took 2 separate quotes and mashed them together to make it appear that something wrong was said.
Wake up, the media lies!

LOL nice try on the spin. Hillary deserves to be in jail. Besides, Trump called for a special prosecutor, so no, that's not dictatorship. Being above the law is the actual problem.

If there was ever any doubt that Trump is a narcissistic, demagogue who knows nothing about the constitution or our system of jurisprudence, his comment yesterday proved it. We saw what he would be like if he had a conflict with any world leader...sniffing or breathing hard, pacing, lurking, bullying like a madman and throwing out verbal bombs nonstop. We would be at war constantly! And all because a mere 3 minutes before the debate began, he was told by the head of the Commission on Presidential Debates that the 4 women, Bill Clinton accusers, would be escorted out of the hall by security if he tried to have them seated in his family box! He couldn't take it that Bannon's plan was thwarted and he couldn't watch Hillary and Bill being shaken and intimidated! He was fuming!!! He LOST and Trump never loses! Just wait till November 9. He'll learn what a loss feels like!

I almost never agree with the orange bigot fond of rape, but Trump was spot on that Hillary deserves to be in jail. Neither one should be president, vote Gary Johnson

Nice spin. But what's dictator talk is "can't we just drone strike this guy" which Hillary said. And she IS a criminal, I'm sure trump is too. But there's actual proof of Hillary's corruption and no-one is doing anything about it. She belongs in prison just like most executives and politicians

Trump promised he would be a strong leader throughout his campaign. If this quote should prove his strength he totally failed.
Unfortunately Americans don't have a medieval history. Otherwise they would recognize immediately where his road leads to.

What a stupid headline. He said he would appoint a prosecutor to look into her transgressions after which time assuming she would end up in jail! Never was the word cage used. Way out of context but I expect nothing less from the Carlos Slim Times.

Who said he's Presidential? He's not running for President. He wants to be a Fascist Dictator. Now, what don't you understand about that? His pledge to put her, "in Prison," without due process should be clear enough for all to see that.

Trump doesn't know anything about how government works. It is not a business where the big boss says jump and his employees ask how high. Congress doesn't work that way. He seems to think that a president can do anything he wants. Or that as a senator Hillary could bend 99 other senators to her will.

This article is stupid as hell. Lol I remember when the NYT actually participated in real journalism versus partisan, biased nonsense to save their failing paper. I'm not even voting for Donald Trump, but this is beyond ridiculous.

A 100% third world dictator type comment. Another stark example of why this sexist, racist, bigoted, hypocritical, reprehensible man-baby is totally unfit for any office ... much less that of the president of the US.

I am pretty sure if he let the justice department actually do their job and didn't play obstructionist games as we have seen over the last 8 years there are many that should be nervous. Hillary included.

LOL---You have to lie about what he said. There are MANY people who have been prosecuted- and convicted- for doing FAR less than Hillary. She has been above the law- because she is in bed with Dictator Obama. That's Third-World- and you know it.

I believe he said he would want his attorney general to appoint a special prosecutor to look into her. That's a far cry from a dictator threatening to put political opponents in cages. NY Times stinks.

First he implies she should be shot, and tonight he states he'd have a special prosecutor assigned to put her in jail. It's the only clear policy point he's made in this whole campaign!

YES !!! and its about time we had a good dictator .. sick to death of all this , lets just all be the best of friends .BS.. it wont work ,,,they dont want to be our friends ,, they want to over throw us ...

Nice try, that's not what he said. He said he would appoint a special prosecutor to investigate Hitlery. Didn't you just lecture me on misleading headlines yesterday Erin Keane?

So The NY Times has him putting opponents in cages?!  And Megan Kelly immediately after the debate first thing out of her mouth..he called Hillary the Devil..REALLY?  I must have missed something!

Wow another lie. Donald Trump never said that. Funny how liberal media twists everything Donald says. This is an unfair election for Donald Trump, if Hillary wins it is not because she is president material.

She would be in jail because he would clean up the Good ole boy, pay to play corruption that rules DC today. Thats not dictator talk its call "Clean up"......maybe the NYT is afraid of that.

Wow,New York Times, you are so good at labeling. Cut a piece of trumps speech and immediately put a label on him. I don't think this is journalism

It is obvious that he is influenced by Putin and if he will became a president of US he follows Putin's example, so putting opponents in prison or similar things for him is quit normal.

You know Trump's style and self congratulatory body language has always reminded me of the Italian Facist Dictator Benito Mussolini. Maybe someone cleverer then I can work up a side by side video comparison. I'm certain it would go viral if well done.

It's dictator talk if you're the liberal biased NY Times but when some one breaks the law they are held accountable EVEN if they run for President...well except in Hillary's case

It sure is dictator talk. And he'd be putting himself there too, according to his rules. Thank God we still have a constitution....that he doesn't even know. Smh dimwit

If you tell a lie over and over again, lots of people are going to believe it. Isn't that right, donald trump? That's your modus operandi in this contentious election.

That isn't dictator talk.  When you say that you believe someone is guilty of something, and you would prosecute them, and imprison them for it, that's called justice.

She absolutely should be in jail. There is something in this country called rule of Law. He also said if any citizen did a fifth of what she did they would be in prison. It's absolutely true. There is a reason I don't take anything the New York Times says with a grain of salt. Where is the dislike button.

I thought it was pretty funny. This election is a joke and he's not going to be president so the least he can do is be entertaining.

Am I the only one understanding that he meant because of emails? No tarmac meetings, no Lynch and Comey favors? I'm a Berner, so I want neither, but this is SPIN.

That assessment is complete hogwash. He did not say he would "Put Political Opponents in Cages". He said that he would have the New Attorney General "appoint a Special Prosecutor" to look into her "Situation."

 It is obvious to even Clinton Supporters that Deleting E-Mails after the US Congress Subpoenaed them to be turned over, Is not only Wrong and Illegal. It is also obvious that Clinton Lied when she said that they were "Personal E-Mails", because FBI Director Comey said that they were able to recover hundreds of "Work Related E-Mails, that had been deleted." It is also Illegal to expose Classified Information to persons without Security Clearance, and that neither the Clinton IT People or the Lawyers that she herself said "Went over every e-mail", had any Security Clearance.

The NY Times is so biased in their reporting on this, in order to get Clinton Elected, that is has lost all Credibility. How said that a once bastion of Journalistic Integrity, has sunk so low.

After backing up so many dictatorships throughout history, I believe you folks really want to live in one, one that is cool and full of guns and where you WASPS can shoot whom ever you want as long as it is a minority. Well, there were some trials at that in Germany, Italy, Spain and Portugal in the 30's. If you are curious go take a look on how it ended so successfully.
On the other hand you seem to continue to think that you live in a "free" country (you don't) but are tired of it and ant some "god" send manly man to tell you what to do, what to think and eat and drink and consume. Because being free is a lot of work and responsibility and one has to assume on's fault's. 
So go and vote Trump, your bodies (specially women's) are finally ready.

He reminds me of Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev at the end of his reign when he was simply unable to understand the reality. His family confirmed many times that Brezhnev wanted to retire but the political leadership of the Soviet Union did not allow him to go as they were able to do whatever they wanted. There are many advantages when the political leader is unable to understand the reality. His team decides, his team makes decisions, and his team can hide themselves and claim themselves victims of injustice and incompetence. I think now you understand those who aggressively defend him. They don't care about him. He is just a means to realize their true goals. To some extend Trump is a victim of all those who claim themselves his supporters. Later on he will be blamed and his supporters will come out of water dry.
When you grow on toxic environment of hatred and insult you cannot a a sweet fruit no matter hard you try to shine.
It is so funny to imagine him at the negotiations. The best thing he can do is be silent. When an uninformed person tries to express opinions it is at least funny and at most stupid. 
We admire former presidents and most of the time we don't care about their party affiliation. When you decide to vote think if you would like to repeat their ideas and accept them as role models. For me President is more than a person sitting in the White House. He is a symbol of intelligence the country has, fairness the protection of its policies, consistency of moral and democratic principles, generosity, forgiveness and support the country guarantees. And finally, I want not to be ashamed when my children repeat whatever the President of this great country says.
P.S. Dear Trump supporters, you might disagree with me but do not practice your insulting and vulgar vocabulary. I have no intention to fight with you.

Dictator? No that's just straight talk. That's just a promise! The collusion between the Obama WhiteHouse, The Loretta Lynch DOJ, pressured and intimidated by Bill Clinton (snake on a plane,) and the The FBI under Comey to obfuscate the truth and protect Hillary from prosecution is a disgrace to our country and a clear corruption of our entire justice system... and has put her above the law that the  rest of us have to abide by. Trump's promise to have a Special Prosecutor look into the case, is justified and supported by many Americans who feel she clearly got a Free Pass To Get Out Of Jail... Justice demands that her lies and obfuscation, her defiant destruction of thousands of emails (evidence) AFTER she was subpoened must not be rewarded or tolerated... And her case reopened for prosecution. Hillary is actually The Dictator to think she can break the law and then suppress the evidence and intimidate, bribe and pressure the entire justice system.

I find it interesting that so many people insist that Hillary is a criminal when every investigation of her, including those run by partisan committees, have not found one thing to charge her with. On the other hand, Trump has admitted to sexual assault, he has two major lawsuits against him; one for rape of a 13 year old and one for fraud. Just because he keeps repeating the same lies over and over doesn't make them true.

So, US citizens voting for a man who doesn't actually understand how the legal and political systems work in his own country. Will be interesting times when he has a tantrum when he discovers that what Trump wants and what he can actually do are very different things -- I suspect he will claim he is being persecuted and call out his armed "troop" -- that mindless rabble with their guns.

Dictators PUT people in jail, torture them, kill their families. He has promised all those things. I think we should believe him and vote accordingly. If he could do those things to our enemies, then he could also do them to Hillary Clinton, he could do them to his female groping victims (he is as guilty of actions as he is of words in that respect) he could do them to me, and to thee. Vote him down. 95-5 % would be nice. If he persuaded an AG to prosecute HC, there is still no chance he could convince a jury, because the facts (in spite of all the politicized investigations against both Clintons) just don't condemn her. So maybe he'd just jail her anyway. For some Trumpistas that would be just fine.

That's was Venezuelan's Chavez way of speaking . Now everyone can see what a screwed up country he left. Don't you guys make the same mistake we did. First he starts out with hate , then goes after politicians who don' t agree with him. then he turns to ordinary folks.

Because youve twisted his words so many times, there's absolutely no reason to trust your integrity NY Times. This is how you feed points to Trump.

There aren't any specifics things orange Trump was talking about, it is simply desperation on his part. Hillary are cleared, move on to new material people. Trump just cannot stand to lose anything and he was simply performing to his base which by the way keeps getting smaller and smaller due to his video. He has no one to blame but himself; he is his own worst enemy!!!!

i don't think he was talking about political opponents! He was referring specifically to Hillary Clinton who was given a pass by the FBI after she destroyed evidence i.e. thousands of e-mails, after they were requested via subpoena! The pass was directed to the FBI by Loretta Lynch in the DOJ who works for Obama! That's called dictatorship!

No that is not dictatorial talk. It simply means that those who secretly used personal servers for official use will not be spared. Those who indulge in actions which are contrary to the safety and security of the US,  none of them would be spared. 
Trump is gonna spare none, be it illegal immigrants, Islamic jihadist, or corrupt members of the govt , both past and present.

Tru mp talked like a dictator and walked around like a stalker and threatened his opponent with prison.  Just the kind of person we don't want running this country. Hillary was calm and poised against the bully. Trump needs to go far far away.

It is not Dictator talk! It's someone finally holding a criminal accountable for her actions!! Our government is corrupt and has failed to bring this woman to justice! We don't have a country without truth and justice! Hillary is a dangerous criminal who should never be allowed back in government let alone the White House!

What a cheesy excerpt. NYT excerpted the opinion piece that distorted what Trump said.  He said he would ask for a special prosecutor. NYT didn't care about what was actually said. They cared about what someone said about it. HRC Was to be investigated for real crimes. Trump was not urging political prosecution.

Not dictator talk. Just a not too far fetched consequence of her own actions and dealing with the fallout of those actions.

Just because you're in bed with mrs Clinton doesn't mean nothing noteworthy happened.

Either way, you're screwed. Good on you.

She'd already be in jail if she weren't the wife of an ex-President. Of course, Loretta Lynch having let HSBC off the hook for laundering money for drug cartels when Comey was on the board of the bank didn't hurt, in terms of quid pro quo.

I've been subscribed to Nyt feed and to be fair to Trump,all of yere story's are highly biased against him.I'm not a fan of either candidate's but what your printing is false.
The media is completely on the side of Hillary,very disappointing but not surprising.

STOP LYING TO US!!! No He did not - She has colluded, has lied to congress and the American people, has destroyed evidence and hindered an investigation - accepted money on behalf of the Clinton foundation while Secretary of State; I.E. paying for access to the United States Government that has influenced both domestic AND foreign policy decisions - her carelessness in an email naming an Iranian scientist working with the US - ended with him being hung - her hands are dirty...and covered in blood - scandal after scandal after scandal has followed her for the last 30 years; with another scandal a few months ago - Bill and the AG on a tarmac -

Exactly what I thought the minute he said it. Sounds like some third world country dictator. This guy gets scarier by the minute. I want more scandalous material to come out so that he doesn't have a snowball's chance in hell of being elected. I do think he is done, though. Thank goodness.

Trump thinks he can jail opponents at will if he's President and faults Hillary for her inability to single handedly change the tax code during her 8 years as Senator. Lol. This is your candidate Republicans.

Once again the media taking what was said out of context. Trump told Hillary because of her actions she should be in jail. None of us can ever get close enough to let her know that we see she operates above the law, its about time someone informed her!

The day before the debate Trump met with Chris Christie. That's where he got that statement from. If Christie can keep himself out of jail over Bridgegate and by chance if Trump wins, CC wants to be attorney general. Lest we forget CC put Ivanka Trump's father-in-law in jail...  Politics is strange.

She belongs in jail and that's not what he said he will appoint a special prosecutor to investigate the times lies right a long side Hillary we all know what he said NYT and it was no where near you're spin

Oh my!  How many previous presidents put anyone in jail?  That is not the job of a president. There is a process. He takes it one step higher by saying this about his opponent. He is so rich that he feels he can't be held responsible for his mouth.

The DNC must really be desperate ... everyone knows he was talking about HRC and Comey would not have been in fear of his political life if he had followed through like the FBI did with Martha Stewart. Remember her ... (and no she did not go to jail for embezzlement, it was one count of lying to the FBI.

Trump obviously does not understand the three branches of government and the checks and balances that are in place so that the executive branch cannot instruct the Judicial branch to prosecute anyone. This is important so a tyrannical dictator cannot take over our country.

And that's libel and lies The New York Times  "dictator talk?" If HRC was anyone but HRC she would be in jail right now for mishandling classified documents that's just a fact. Marines and other military personnel and less prestigious politicians have been court marshaled and worse for compromising national security and foreign policy with a single email or communication not through proper channels. Hillary also lied about saying the "FBI saw nothing wrong" when even the PBS commentators could produce evidence of the FBI director saying how careless and damaging her behavior was.

This is what I found most disturbing about the debate. It's a dictatorship when you appoint people with the specific intent to jail your opponent. This is a democracy, for christ's sake. When you win, you shake hands with your opponent, and peacefully go to work on your plans to help the American people.

Not sure now about the benefits of facebook: it has given voice to millions of idiots! Oh wait! It is the First Amendment right! That's ok.... Some are just small minds or cacatúa minds -I should say- that only repeat what they hear. Trump is an inept, incompetent and now disgusting candidate. Period!

Will Wilkinson correctly identifies the most frightening point of last night's debate: the applause for Trump's "You'd be in Jail" statement.  Trump's brought the very worst of America out into the open for all to see and has made open hate talk seem respectable. How do we recover from this?

His repeated attack on her 30 years of service."but why didn't you do it? Why didn't you? Why didn't you get it done?" Demonstrate his lack of understanding on how our democracy works. 
His "you're fired" mentality will not work in the White HOUSE and he has no idea.

He is a dog, pig, idiot, moron, foolish, stupid, liar, racist, rapist, hater, con, clown, , discriminator, unfit, looser, doesn't know what he is talking about, unqualified, criminal who doesn't pay taxes. It's shame on America that he gets this far in presidential election.

Why is it not enough that she has NOT been found guilty of any of these so called "crimes". In what court of law will she be prosecuted? So tired of the uninformed....

I believe the framers of the Constitution took the reality of human errancy into account by drafting the Bill of Rights and ensuring that justice is not political. Too bad for Donald that he was born into a nation of laws.

Uhm no. He said that he would ask for further scrutiny in a special court. The guy is crazy and his views distorted, but let's not become him by distorting what he said. ;) Biased journalism alert.

As much as I detest Trump, I have to say this is very poor reporting. 

Trump quipped that the brunt of the law should be applied to a woman who was under federal investigation. I'm still divided as to whether or not what Hillary did deserves jail time, but for Trump to hold the opinion that it does is not itself deplorable.

It's rubbish rhetoric like this NYT why Trump has such a massive supporter base..problem for you this time is people watched it with their own eyes and know you are now blatantly lying disgusting propaganda

As a lawyer was shocked by the absolute bullying of Clinton when he told her he would have a Special Investigator appointed if he became President - also his 'extreme vetting' concept was terrifying.

...I live in a third world country(Brazil)...is saidlike there are criatures like Mrs. Clinto around thebloge with a media totlly controled...(the former president ofmycountry is envolved in a cloud of doubt... infortunelly maybe the good people of US find the truth ust before elections)

But the NYT is okay with shooting and arresting peaceful protest to protect native land for corporate greed and environmental destruction? Joke. Do some reporting one time

Why is he allowed to take the microphone anymore.... since when are we listening to insanes,,,, in the middle age this were the "fools", he might even had been unable to work as a "jester"...because even a "jester" needs a minimun of self-reflection, moral and intelligence...

This is the same guy who is proposing a new branch of law enforcement to scour and purge society of Mexicans. You can't do that without disregarding the Constitution. In just one year we have become desensitized to the death threats and non-stop calls for imprisonment of a candidate that dares to defy him. We are so much better than this.

This election has come down to the elites and regular folks. People are sick and tired of being called dumb, stupid, ignorant, racist and every other name the liberal elitist can think of! Enough!

Quero ver quando sofrerem o 2 atentado o presidente das filipinas ja tah resolvendo e voces? Vao servi cafezinho pros terroristas? Deixo ver acho que sim kkkkkkkk (parem de sonhar o mundo que a queda de voces chamam muito atenção pra si proprio) tomem medidas drasticas a senhora do bom dia nao resolvera gravara o melhor comercial e nao resolvera nada.

He needs a lobotomy. That should take care of the insane disconnected third grade sentence structure and the abject denial that he cares so much about everyone outside of his special little kkk playgroup!

A special prosecutor should look into her and the way the FBI allowed her lawyers to shape the investigation. If nothing to hide why did so many of her people get immunity deals?

This is the most scariest thing about Trump that he'll lock up his political opponents like Vladimir Putin does in Russia and what two bit banana Republic dictators do. This is not what Americans value. This is not who we are.

Stalin locked up the people that ran against him after he won. Donald Trump plans, if he wins the presidency, to do the same thing and lock up his opponent. He said that tonight in the presidential debate. I don't know if people are paying attention or understand what that means.

Trump is the one that could end up in jail. After they look at his and his son's Foundations. And his taxes, and if anything more comes out about him sexually assaulting someone, he could get  big time in prison.

The fact that people applauded when Trump said he would put Clinton in jail shows how effective the fox lie machine has been all these years.

The climb of politicians is sometimes called The Greasy Poll in the UK. Whilst Hilary isn't the dominant communicator that Trump is, she's a Hawk who will defend will talons than blundering force.

Billy Bush better find a country that has no extradition treaty with the U.S. Who knows what's on order for him if Mr. Trump becomes President

the more he talks the more people will realize that he will not adhere to the US Constitution but write his own, that is what dictators do and he has always been one in business and he sure won't change now at age 70.

He never said he would put political opponents in cages! Shame on you! You are worse than Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton!!!!! He said he would have his attorney general appoint a special prosecutor to look into Hillary Clinton's email scandal and that he predicted she would be in jail!

Some one said "9 hearings" bahahahaha and that's a good thing! I'm not trying to talk trash or point the finger but 9 hears and she hasn't been found guilty of anything is a good thing for a presidential candidate! COME ON!!

Once, ancient Athenians sent-off an eloquent messenger to threaten the ancient Spartans. The messenger appreared before the austere Spartan Senate. The stoic Spartans were ready to listen. "If we come here we will burn your City", the messenger thundered. "If we come here, we will take your women, enslave your children, burn your crops, take your livestock. The Athenian messenger had done his best job ever. There was dead silence. The messenger was a bit uneasy. "Well...what is your response?" The elderly Spartan in charge of the response to the Athenians spoke quietly. His one-word response stayed immortal through time: "IF."

HRC has been investigated on about everything. I'm surprised they haven't questioned her on the death of JFK. You bet your donkey butt, if they could prosecute her they would of by now. They have nothing! A bunch of Conspiracy Theorists... Rumors are just that rumors. But GOP doesn't believe in facts or Science...

I just saw what an ill man he looked. This is really taking a toll on his health. The sniffing continued, is he on drugs? His skin colour looks like he might be. 
      Hillary stood tall and looked strong and healthy.

The New York Times suddenly develops a problem with keeping political prisoners?

REALLY?

Or just members of the .01% threatening to treat other elites like peons?

When the previous leaders have put the political opponents of other countries in jail and killed them (Iraq, Libya and many more) what's wrong if a political leader who does wrong with the common people goes to jail.

Hey,New York Times.....you might as well take the time now to blame Trump for everything he is going to say! that seems to be about as fair as you can be!!

I said exactly the same thing last night! I was born in Venezuela we have seeing this before and we know the results! It's called "political persecution"

I had hoped that Hillary might start the debate by handing Trump a box of Orange Tic Tacs so that he would know from the outset that he’s not fooling anyone. I didn’t get my wish, but NYT Readers can make it come true.
Please mail 1 box of Orange Tic Tacs to:
Donald J. Trump
Trump Towers 
725 5th Ave, 
New York, NY 10022

There you have it. The real Trump. The last President that asked the AG to prosecute his political enemies was Nixon in watergate. We know how that ended.

This headline is beyond misleading . It is garbage reportage, typical of the left leaning NYT . I am no fan of Trumps but frustrated that the media picks sides and reports according to their agendas .

Moot point. It will NEVER happen.... His presidency I mean....

Embarassments are often hidden in calm demeanors. But wasn't she really embarassed?!!! Of course theres a feasibility that Hilary could land in jail if Trump wins. Could Hilary say that of Trump?

Trump the Clown wants to run a dictator-style government in the US,he reminds me so much of Nigeria's Buhari,both men are confused,ignorant,arrogant,dishonest & crazy!

Any comments made on here are moot because the New York Times has just posted a lie. I don't think the word cage was used once during the debate tonight, at all, from anyone, in any context. If you're going to repeat what someone said, then repeat what they said. Don't use your words to convey their thought when they chose the word they wanted to use to convey the thought.

Please do, get the America respect back. America and the law enforcement respect was depleted after they let her free. Trump for president

Add fascist to the list of tRump adjectives and descriptive nouns, right under racist and bigot, but before misogynist and chauvinist.

He is apologising for one thing he has said,and then saying something even worse!  He is going to be fully occupied with apologising for his wrong  sayings.

America, you might call this an election, but the rest of the world is viewing it as your I.Q. test voting for Trump. And it's not looking good.

http://youtu.be/Qg0pO9VG1J8

If he gets elected he says he will go after the Clinton's. It will be J. Edgar Hoover all over again... but worse! It won't be just the Clinton's.

This should be of no surprise to anyone. Those that support him should not be surprised as they probably agree and those that don't support him made that choice, at least in part, because they see him for what he is.

Trump looked like a walking zombie tonight at the debate.. I wonder what kind of pills he's on with all that sniffling and dry mouth

That concerns me, too. If he really feels that the belong in jail, he should be advocating that with his elected legislators right now, whether he's elected or not. I don't mean riling people up. I mean petitions or meetings, communications like email, phone whatever. Im also curious if he has any active communication with local legislators both big and small. I get angry about criminals in my area not being arrested, too. I petition all sorts of people: law enforcement, state rep, governor and white house. There are criminals in my life never arrested in spite of admissions of guilt. I'm just wondering if he is actively involved in the process he runs for or just gets ppl angry and frustrated and uses it for his own gain.

No not dictator talk you SILLY ANIMALS. She has screwed up horribly and hasn't been held accountable. She should be in prison as well as all the people that are helping cover everything up

He has absolutely no idea what the President actually does.  He seems to think it entitles him to be judge, jury, and executioner or anyone that irks. him.  The idea that anyone would vote for him is so beyond the pale of ludicrous.

We need term limits!  The only candidates talking about that are Johnson and Weld. We need to get the entrenched corrupt career hacks out of the legislature.

so fed up with the media, people do have minds ,ears and eyes , the public can make their own decisions on what actually was said and in what content .

Acho que ele já se enterrou, uma pessoa construída em tantos absurdos simplesmente não consegue sustentar nada palatável Letícia Castro 😂😂

Isn't that what the country's been clamouring on about for the past year now? Why the hell isn't she in jail? He didn't say he'd arbitrarily toss her into the clink. In a nutshell he said he'd have a real investigation done, the toss her into the clink.

I get it now. Trump trolls, who suffer from poor reading comprehension, thought the writer of this piece was actually quoting their hero here: "He said, in a widely watched televised presidential debate, that if he became president, he would put political opponents in cages. That’s dictator talk."

That's not a quote. (Well, it is when I use it, because I'm quoting the author. The author wasn't directly quoting Trump. You can tell, because he didn't use quotation marks.) He used Trump's exact words earlier in the piece.  If you had larger vocabularies, you might know that "cage" is often used as a synonym for "jail cell." Does that make things more clear for you? Or do I need to explain what a synonym is?

Seems like there are mostly unqualified Americans and I wish to be proven wrong. Surely there must be better and more suitable candidates or is this the worst job in the world?

This plan was about the only one he explained during the dabate and it literally struck fear in me. He does not understand the law, specifically due process.

And this is how leftist pages like this one try to spin it. This page is despicable. I only keep it to see just how far they are willing to go to heed their masters bidding!

So other people who are serving sentences for similar crimes have been under dictatorial Whitehouse or what!? That includes Gen Patreus under Obama. Being a presidential candidate doesn't absolve anyone criminally liable from a jail term unless she HRC. #Corruption

Right, holding people in power accountable for their misdeeds is "Dictator" talk. Putting Bush, Cheney, Obama, and Hillary in a cage is what is needed.

I'm not a Trump fan, but this is a flat out lie. That's not at all what he said. He said that if he were president, Clinton specifically would be in jail because of her illegal activities. I just lost all respect for this publication.

Not even Ronald Reagan could do what he wanted. Checks and balances in the US are just too strong for any potential Dictator to rise.

the orginal script if I remember clearly, his opponent said he will charge the law, and then he said she'd be in jail.

And I think we should give trump a chance in the White House he will do well Hilary has been in government for 30 years and has failed America trump has never been in the government give him a chance let's see what he can do we know what Hilary does we have nothing left to lose at this point

Umm...perhaps because she is an opportunistic liar who believes she is, and therefore acts as if she is, above the law?  Might just have something to do with it.

It's sad to see a man like Trump running for president of the USA.  A morally bankrupt, mendacious bully, with no civic feeling whatsoever, Trump  is a made in USA nightmare.

Maybe he should go to jail for Trump U,  taking money deposits for condos, then skipping out on them, not paying his contractors, sexual assaults, etc.

He said he'd put Hillary in jail cause she's a crooked politician and there's more then enough proof to it. Your title is completely misleading well didn't expect much else from you guys

He did not say cages.  He said jail because that is where she should be.  She has exposed our national secrets to hackers.  She lied to the FBI and the American people.  Others have gone to jail, not cages, for less.

No it's not; it's called if you commit a crime you do the time. This is the type of journalism that Americans are sick of- HRC had immunity deals for her staff. They destroyed evidence. She went to law school. She knows better.

There is no possible way an outsider should beat HRC on its face but when you have so many faces and sides over the years it makes it an actual race

Anyone else would be in jail for far less- dictators protect their own and manipulate the law- so maybe look at the Obama administration.

There is a reason that people don't cross Trump. He is the Vengeance candidate. That is why he and Putin have created a mutual admiration society!

Look the bottom line is this. America could be voting in a potential Pedophile. Teh court case for the girl who was raped when she was 13 is to be heard in December. Now normally anyone who has such a horrendous case against them usually steps aside until the matter has been heard. Now what if he wins, does this poor girl not only suffer a rape, a threat of being killed, and then silenced because a president cant go on trial? I think the media need to give the women who have been abused by Trump the strength and opportunity to come forward and talk about what they have suffered. They need to be helped, they need support, we want to hear there voices, we want to share there pain. We are here for them. I cant make the point of view clear enough. We want to hear your voices, you have suffered in silence for too long. http://www.huffingtonpost.com.au/entry/why-the-new-child-rape-ca_b_10619944

Wow. Really. Realllllllllllly reaching here. I can't wait until this election is over so we can have real stories again.

The NYT is trying to scare those who did not see the debate. Clinton's problem is  hypocrisy. She takes money from the shady donors who use the same loopholes as Trump. And, as a Senator, she is in charge of the tax code!

Best moment of the night was Bill Clinton's face when he realized the women he had raped and abused were in the front row! The women deserved to confront their abusers/rapist. For years they have been dismissed and shamed. I am glad these innocent women had their chance to confront the Clinton's, who belong in jail not on stage.

Legal voters in The US. are now availed to eight years of evidence "As democracy is being destroyed by sociopath individuals, the office of the president represents an inner circle of subversive anti-American entities including the criminal Clintons" and the radical media networks who promote their dangerous agendas

This coming from a TRAITOR that violated the Cuban and Iranian Embargoes. Trump needs to be investigated, tried, and immediately shot if found guilty!

Trump like a raging bull... trying to intimidate because he has nothing else to give. He is nothing else than a clown. He is the one who should be locked up in a cage.

No he didn't say that. He didn't say that he'd put his political opponents in jail. He said he'll instruct the attorney general to investigate Clinton's situation.

So the people who mock the 2nd amendment crowd for saying they need guns in case the US gets a dictator, are now claiming we could elect a dictator?

If you hadn't figured out till today the entire campaign is all about him, than all you Trump supporters are not far from being as delusional as him.

Ok he didn't say that! Stop making things up! He said he would investigate Clinton, and she would be in jail! And she deserves to be!

That is why he is so scary to me.  Read the LEFT BEHIND book series!!! It will make you think about a lot of what is going in today........

That is what the Turkish Dictator Recep does. And Trump is cut from the same cloth. That sense of entitlement, no respect for anyone, low low low.

I am not a Trump suuporter but am saddened how much of the media is all in for Hillary. I thought the press was supposed to be impartial.

It's what's currently happening here in the Philippines. Guys, don't be like us. Don't vote for the idiot. It's not yet too late for you.

Because she is a criminal... Anyone else who did what she has done would already be behind bars. Prime example of the pro Hillary media

Trump's an idiot and a bad person but the notion that powerful people in this country are not held accountable for their actions is not dictatorial or controversial.

Enough ! No one will go to jail without any proof. Buy HC has done some wrongful deeds in the past which requires her yo serve in jail !!!

Why didn't  the moderators ask any questions about what has just been released by wikileaks and has the NYT never printed these statement in her speeches to by Hillary clinton that among other things her dream is of open borders, and she has a public position and a private position. This is her private position on immigration Direct quote ".. The main reason behind successful immigration is painfully obvious to even the most dimwitted...some groups are almost always successful given half a chance. Jews, Hindus, Sikhs and Chinese while other groups Muslims Blacks and |Romas fare badly irrespective of circumstance..."

"That’s dictator talk."
because having the press in the tank for a politician doesn't remind us of the soviet union ------ nope, not at all...........

She broke the law and got a free pass from the doj! Come on! What she did was a crime and imagine what else, what we don't know...yet! Seriously, stop with the biased reporting. Its ridiculous!

Obama should have put Bush and Cheney on trial. Who else is supposed to do it? But they shook hands and carried on like nothing happened.

That's not what he said! But an absolutely great way to show that you are a completely biased newspaper. And by newspaper that is a term that is a very far stretch for what I've seen

Pumpkin face is a school yard bully who should b put in jail for making threats. This dude who has failed businesses left and right is no champion for America.

I'm a Clinton supporter but Trump was electrifying! There's no way out of it. To turn it around like that was nothing short of unbelievable! Hillary's big, clunky campaign is getting in her way. She's known for her sharp, quick wit. Yet, she constantly hesitated in order to come off as presidential. It's a stupid strategy dreamed-up by overpaid "yes" men. Clinton needs to start playing to her strengths. She's qualified, she's experienced, and she's not a reality TV star who says franchised lines like "you're fired". Here's hoping she comes prepared for the next debate!

No, that's law & order. When the president is a liberal pansy, and your DOJ is completely corrupt, yes, you can get away with a few crimes here and there. 

....but when everyone is held accountable, Hillary goes to prison.

He said to instruct his AG to investigate Hillary Clinton's accusations, and if found guilty, to be put in Jail, which is OK for any criminal. Trump our Trumpet

Make no mistake, the office dump is running for is Dictator. After all, he has absolutely no idea how the US Constitution and government actually works

Generally speaking that's where criminals go.. I think people on both sides of the isle belong in a cage for the things they have done to this nation.

I'm not for Trump but but I don't appreciate the NYtimes for creating a lie to support Hilary! He said he'd put her in jail not because she's against him but because it's been proven she's broken the law dozens of times!

Yeah! That's how The Basket of Deplorables roll in Russia, Eastern Block or African dictator-communist countries. They say the Election is going to be rigged if they lost, and if they win, they will jail their opponent! SICKENING! This is the UNITED STATES OF AMERICA not a BANANA COUNTRY

Between the Obamas loosing there license to practice law due to corruption so they don't go to jail same with the Clintons both lost their law degrees for corruption and bypass jail

Lol I hate Trump but NYT just took his comment out of context for sure. Anyone can clearly see this.

Welcome to a reality that many of us have known for a long time: Donald Trump is a threat to anyone and everyone.

DT won. He was more effective because of his short sentences and use of keywords.
HC told people to go to her site, during a debate meant for explaining yourself.
DT is becoming smarter with his talking points and that's a problem for HC

No it's not! It's justice talk! Clintons have gotten away with crime after crime for decades. It's time a strong leader makes a Clinton pay and this country is mad as hell at the establishment and the rigging of laws favored for corrupt politicians. This is justice!

He said Hill shud be in jail, not he wud put political opponents n jail.........im not Trump supporter....but dont sink to his level....

I don't care about you being a biased journal. But lying is just so uncalled for. He was referring to the email scandal that she got away from unpunished.

To you folks still holding on: you picked up a snake and a s snake will bit and even eat you alive! You have been warned. Don't ask why me later. Put down and walk away.

Love the liberties the times takes with free speech. You were the paper of record. That is the real sad day in America.

Newspapers, media and politicians are all bought and paid for. Most belong in Prison!!
They don't work for we the people. They work for the Devil!!

Trump punked her out.. She didn't see it coming.. Even the audience applauded Trump... And the Hillary supporters can;t take it either... HAHAHAHA

WHATEVER!!

Sexual assault doesn't apply for just talking "HYPE." MR. Trump was talking about what he could conceivably get away with because women allow it due to his celebrity status.  Putting this in perspective, rock stars go to concerts and females throw their panties at them both while on stage, and in the back rooms if they can reach them. Basically, he was bragging that he is a rock star and women throw themselves at him. SAD, but a fact of life.

He's not nearly as bad as Clinton. She's the real racist and a criminal.

He's a thug, bum and loser who appeals to mobs of racist, sexist, homophobic, Muslim hating losers like him.

NYT your "opinion" section is worthless and has no journalistic integrity.

Watched the debate and Sean Riddle he even proposed any Obama officials to be purged out of the office and put Trump officials in that have connections to Donald Trump himself. To me i see him as Rodrigo Duterte of the United States due to his personality and embracememt of dictatorship like Vladimir Putin's Russia Xi Jinping's China Assad's syria & Kim Jong Un's North Korea

Scary, very scary.
I can't wait untill he is out of politics.

He seriously has no idea how the world works. Bully, sue, grab, and ruin. That's all he knows.

Trump's talk and worldview is similar to the hate, threats and bigotry the pilgrims fled from. Trump is an anti-American.

You want to laugh for an hour???? Ask a Trump Supporter "For What?". Be prepared to hear some of the most idiotic conspiracy theories ever.

Yeah & Trumps all squeaky clean. Imma leave this right here.

http://m.huffpost.com/us/entry/10619944

Dictator of trump international! People listen ! The american idiot! And if you vote for him Just cause you don't like Hilary - shame on you for your country!

That's dictator talk? a ridiculous interpretation of events! Leftist media manipulators working overtime.

No, he said he would put corrupt politicians like Hillary in jail by using a special prosecutor to validate what everyone knows.

I whish to know who is the owner of the New york times? some Rothschild? Soros? rockefeller's?

new low for you the new York times. its clear that was about the investigation and illegal issues involving only Clinton.

Umm, he is a dictator and continues to show us that he is....

Thank you!  We heard the voice of a dictator tonight and it was scary.

And the talk of somebody who has always gotten his way and is shocked when he's opposed

Only the GOP would find this tyrannical response appealing.

Oh my gosh. I'm 'shocked' to see The NY Times make such a outrageous claim; really I am😚

New York Times will go out of business soon. They are posting false information and trying to brainwash people.

Special prosecutor for stupidity.. that's more like it, Drumpf minions!!

The New York Times is so biais...no one tonight mentioned "cages"...only more bs from that left wing rag...

Kellyanne and Trump supporters are going to stand by Donald Trump no matter what he does... The acceptance of sexual assault is now part of the Republican Party platform and Trump supporters have embraced this. To all my true republican friends it's time to break from your party and form a new party that reflects your true values because the Republican Party you knew is now gone and in the hands of a man who has destroyed it.

He should be in jail for sexual abuse and his many unwanted sexual advances

Donald trump should file a lawsuit for the blatant slander that is this headline.

The criterion for Trumpenstein is not whether something is "true" but whether it has emotional impact on his followers.

"he would put political opponents in cages."  Huh?   You lying Slime

Lol totally spun that comment he made... I'm not a trump supporter by any means. But that's not what he was implying but putting political opponents in jail... he was implying that Hillary is a liar and the proof is in the Wikileaks email dump. 

Vote another option Johnsonweld.com

Now I understand why Trump says that the new York times is a failing newspaper ...

Here we go again lol the NY times demonizing trump for some thing about 50% of national vote  believe should happen

He's a terrorist to humanity I want him brought to an international court

Because he is a dictator and unfit to be an American president.

I'm starting to think the New York Times needs a safe space. They keep getting triggered.... lol

Sorry not buying that line of thought. He is saying that to his base regarding the email issue which the base believes it was a coverup to protect her.

He is worse than animal because he is going use the prestige of the office to get even with his opponents. What is the point of running this if he is not going to serve all?

We must do everything in our collective power to keep this monster out of the White House. Please vote! iwillvote.com

The judiciary are supposed to be independent of government so the President can't put anyone in jail, only a judge can.

The New York Times is in cahoots with the liberals I watched the debate I did not take come away with anything other than anyone else would be in jail

Steven Hill I loved the Abe Lincoln burn but this was the biggest #rekt of the night

No, typical distortion by the NYTimes, he said he'd put a particular criminal in jail, specifically Hillary Clinton

If Hillary wasn't running for pres they would have brought charges against her

Oh now you are distorting this again.  You cannot fool us because we all watched the debate, NYT.

This is becoming a comedy show - he is the biggest manipulator going.
It would be interesting to see how many women vote for him

It was a debate between arrogance and grace - where Trump emerged as a prophet of arrogance and Hillary as godess of Grace.

This is such a horrible misquote!!!!   Come on NY Times, you can do better than this....

HEY NY TIMES WHY DON'T YOU ASK HILLARY ABOUT HAITI AND HER CLINTON FOUNDATION ??

Truth will set me free trump your not deserve to be president of United States of America hilary clinton go ahead and god bless you amen...

I can't stand Trump (not a Hillary fan either) but that is not what he said or what he was implying....

tell the truth new york times its the least you can do for the american ppl

If he had his way, he would put anyone (especially women) who ever said no to him and not let him do whatever he wants to do!

the foolish new york times lying in order for the canal minded hillary to win.

And how new york times can put a quote from someone else article after saying "Donald trump said..."?? He didn't say that.

This is the most ridiculous stretch. 100% loss of respect for the New York Times.

He is nothing but a bully and a dictator. Can't be a President

Sec. Clinton was found not to be guilty of committing any crimes, he might not like the out come but that's a Fact.

Looks like the editor the NY Times is sleeping as usual. Wake up editor, you are paid to make sure inaccurate stuff like this does not get through.

You lying shits, he said he'd put her in jail, not "in a cage." Trey Gowdy will be just the man to do it, after he's confirmed as AG.

Who is he running against for president? Hillary Clinton? Or Bill Clinton? I feel that he's running against Bill Clinton's ghost.

This is a petty article. She belongs in jail, just like any other criminal.

He's brought the National Inquirer  to the presidency.

Took freedom of the press a little too far this time. Straight up lie lol

She's already been tried for her crimes. You can't retry people on the same charge.

OBAMA, HILLARY AND THE ROTHSCHILD SERVING NY TIMES FASCIST TERRORIST WRITERS FOR PRISON!!!!!!

For her criminal activity and perjury, she should be in jail.

Another example of how liberals can twist people's words to make them fit the Democratic Liberal agenda !!

Correct. I'm sure you've heard about Hugo Chavez. Same profile The New York Times!

Frightening indeed if people applause such a speech...

There goes The New York Times taking things way out of context again...

Que grande mentira de new york times jajaja how ignorant Dumb do they think we really are that they lie too us like this

Trump infinitely superior and nailed hrc on her lies and deleting emails after subpoena and every issue debated

Don't be idiots. This is from an opinion page writer. And for the record, jail is putting someone in a cage. http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/projects/cp/opinion/clinton-trump-second-debate-election-2016/because-youd-be-in-jail

Join the millions of Americans who REJECT the values of the Democrat and Republican party. No WikiLeaks. No Hot Mics. Not beholden to financial industry special interests. Gary Johnson is a former two-term Governor with a solid track record. Join us and join the next American Revolution. VOTE your values, VOTE Gary Johnson for President. #YouIn? #2016JohnsonWeld

You don't have to choose between Bill's principal enabler and Trump. Vote Gary Johnson. 

BTW before you mention Aleppo read below. 
Hillary,"we were under sniper fire"

Hillary,"we left the Whitehouse dead broke"

Hillary,"I was instrumental in the Irish peace process"

Hillary,"A hateful video caused Benghazi"

Hillary replied “I don’t know” a whopping 327 TIMES during her e-mail investigation. After SMASHING 13 iPads and iPhones!

Hillary," We all knew he was guilty as hell *laughs*" -when talking about a child molester she defended and won for 

Hillary, “floozy,” “bimbo” and “stalker,”effort to cast doubt on the Bill's accusers. 

Wolff: “And Brexit? Your position?” Trump: “Huh?” 
Wolff: “Brexit.” 
Trump: “Hmm.” 
Wolff: “The Brits leaving the EU.” 

Trump,"I remember watching the firefighters on 7/11"

Trump,"I will defend article 11 of the constitution!"

Trump,"I don't know why there are 13 stripes on the flag"

Trump thought Quds=Kurds

Trump,"I don't think my daughter Ivanka would pose for playboy, although she does have a very nice figure, I've said if Ivanka weren't my daughter perhaps I'd be dating her"

Trump about a married woman:"Yeah, that’s her. With the gold. I better use some Tic Tacs just in case I start kissing her. You know, I’m automatically attracted to beautiful — I just start kissing them. It’s like a magnet. Just kiss. I don’t even wait. And when you’re a star, they let you do it. You can do anything." 
"Grab ’em by the p***y. You can do anything."

The New York Times just showed its an important part of the Orwelian mass media of our days by using words that were never used and taking things out of contex...+ Most importantly: Trump won this debate! Everybody saw it...And I am glad to see so many people actualy REALIZE what a manipulation tool and a JOKE the NY Times is (judging by many of the comments)!

So it's a cage if Hillary is in it, but prison for someone who smokes weed. Makes sense,The New York Times

I think he means she would be persecuted for her crimes.

A Pakistani boy took admission in an American school ...
Teacher : Whats your name ?
Boy : Nadir
Teacher : No, now you are in America, your name is Johnny from today.
Boy went home and his mother asked: How was the day Nadir?
Boy : I am an American now, so call me Johnny.
Mom and Dad both got offended and beat him up.
Next day he was back to school all bruised ...
Teacher : What happened Johnny ?
Boy: Ma'm, just 6 hours after I became American, I was attacked by two Pakistani terrorists.

This idiot forgets there are civil rights in this country.

'He grabbed me:' Woman alleges Trump groped her exactly as described on tape

Jill Harth, a pageant owner trying to work with Trump in the mid-1990s, filed suit against him in federal court in Manhattan in 1997, describing a “relentless” campaign of sexual harassment and assault including an incident in which he reached under a table, put his hands on her thighs and grabbed her “intimate private parts” during a meeting at a New York restaurant.

http://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-words-echo-womans-allegations-507763

"political opponents"? It is unfair to tamper with what Mr. Trump really said. He may well say that he would put HILLARY in jail if he became president because she is an out-and-out traitor to the U.S. ,selling lots of state secrets to PRC by taking advantage of her position as the Secretary of State.

A man who would not tolerate anyone who disagreed with him..They would be out the door double quick..Not the kind of person we need in the White House.

Oh please you spineless biased liberal bankrupt newspaper! trump was telling the public politicians that break the law will be prosecuted ---HRC is the worst bandit around

Trump wld be in the cell next to hers. A rape case was just filed against Trump!

Once we get rid of Trump, what do we do with his supporters?

More precisely, he openly threatened to do this to Hillary herself!

your fact check about Hillary and open borders is wrong...this was in releases emails of Wikileaks !

Methinks that he had really gone way deep in his admiration of Putin and Kim Jong-Un. >:(

This headline only backs Trump's comments about mainstream media. Thanks NYT

Says the man that bribes states attorneys and uses a charity as s slush fund.

If he win, he would use the Justice to pursue his political goals. That is very scarry. Stalin style.

Apparently, he believes in some of the elements of fascism.

GOOD LORD!! That headline is a BLATANT LIE. The NYT reaches new lows every day.

Trump-splainin' Trump has no moral footing, even worse are his evangelical remoras that accept sin for tax evasion just like him.

Yes! That was my reaction. It IS dictator talk. It's third-world, coup, crazy, unconstitutional talk.

Using the justice - bad guy Trump 
Using hitmen - presidential Hillary 

????

Perhaps he just meant SHE would be in jail....lord knows others are already there for far less than shes done.

Betting most of these commentators didn't even take a moment to open the article.

Betting most of these commentators didn't even take a moment to open the article.

Stop. Don't bother. Nobody even cares anymore. It literally doesn't matter.

A lot of good people would be in jail if he were able to become dictator.

Lol sound bites and suckers..he said she should be in jail.

She behave like a lady, very professional to such attack. Please note I am a republican..

"And nobody seems to like him, they can tell what he wants to do ... The fool on the hill..."

BS!!! This is why I can't stand most media outlets and she should be in jail.

Amazing he says and does anything he wants someone retaliates and he crys

You can't accuse him later of doing this, because he has shown his true colours now of who he is!

Funny, I just posted the video that disproves this article...

Pair that with Omarossa talking about how his enemies would have to "bow down" at his feet and I'm freaking TERRIFIED.

I think what he means is that the FBI AND THE CIA would not be afraid of doing their JOBS.

Democrats trying too hard to make him look bad. So a Clinton's blowj** as president,in the presidential office is acceptable but saying the word p**y is not?????

He didn't say "political opponents" would be put in jail, just Hillary for all of the laws she has broken.

You guys are ridiculous ! She'd be in jail because she is a criminal

Everyone keeps saying this is nyt reporting their opinion. This is from the nyt opinion section. Makes sense! More sense than "Donald Trump makes a good president"

You really have trouble understanding his plain talk. Don't you?  Nice try, though.

That's the kind of behavior that makes Putin such a good leader!

Trump put more of his dark, ugly soul on display yesterday.... down with Trump👎

He would put criminals in jail....thats how it should be.....no one should be above the law.....look at how mugabe and zuma from Africa get away with being above the law......why would anyone defend that....

The Trump I saw tonight tells me the people who should fear him most are the media. The media in the USA has to say goodbye to their freedom if he becomes the president.

If anyone should be in prison, it's tax evading, abuse of charitable foundation, Trump.

It's called due process. It's in the constitution, not that that document means anything to Drumpf or his supporters

"Applying the law as he sees it" - I think that is text-book dictatorial.

Well after all Clinton has done, any fair justice system would have her in jail.

When one breaks the law they go to jail. That happens in most any society.

Hillary in jail would only be like pressing the 'Home' button on the Internet. That's where she belongs.

"Dictator talk"? Stupid human being, no? Please, he's fake, stupid, scaring, the beast with a tie.

That is someone who knows that she is a criminal and needs to be in jail.

His constituents think that is the winning line from the debate.

Is it providence or divine intervention when your opponent keep shooting himself in the foot?

I think he referred to appointing a special prosecutor to investigate her crimes

This lying piece of crap paper, is every bit as unethical as the lying hag it is unable to prop up.

In contrast with Trump, who says he would jail Hillary, Clinton says if she is elected she will make sure Trump "gets the help he needs."

Of course Hillary deserves to be in jail for all the crimes she committed, including murder and perjury !

Lmao she broke the law! So nyt supports criminals evading prosecution?! Pathetic

americans have become too dumb to sustain a functioning democracy.

Whell, if he jails middle-aged fat white males like me, then that's a plus, innit, NYT.

Reading through the comments, I am reinforced in my conviction that the scariest part about Trump is his supporter base!

No, it was jailing a murderous criminal that he was referring to, NYT. Get it right!

Well, she and her husband should have been locked up several times already!

Only the educated would understand that very true comparison, but thank you NYT for pointing it out.

USA is so "FREE" that a newspaper can say: "We gonna support this candidate" and they do it! 

😶😶😶😶

That's a serious misrepresentation. NYT start giving the whole truth and facts. You lose credibility every time one of your writers gets upset over Trump.

You gotta love the spin put on his comment of having Hillary jailed. Then they chalk up to their "Opinion Section" unbelievable !

I thought her smile was great. Just another way to confirm how WHATEVER Trump says is absolutely and unequivocally absurd!

trump has committed the greatest crime the media can imagine.....he will not conform to their speech code......he actually believes in the 1st amendment

Double jeopardy? No, perpetual jeopardy...keep trying until you get the result you knew before you started! Un-American.

As if we needed more evidence that the U.S. is heading down the road to fascism.

Cause if he can't control, oppress or grope them, his preference is to cage them.......................

He wouldn't know 'the law' if it slapped him in the face!

Eso es un espectáculo circense romano ¡ qué buen chiste ...¡ jjjjeeejjjej

Dictators historically  have had a tendency to cage or imprison their opponents to silence opposition.

He doesn't know enough about presidential limits and he wants to be a dictator.

They need to both go to jail, along with anyone who voted for these morons.

If that man wins... I'm sure the rest of the world will be very disappointed. ..

Nyt why don't you give credit when credit is due he put clinton in her place and made sure America got a clear picture of who she is

Donald would be the end of American Democracy.  Everything he touches is poisoned.

There are plenty of GOP senators who belong in Guantanamo.

Any good man would put crooks In jail when they are in power. #makeamericagreatagain

I don't think you people realize they're quoting the article and not Trump.

How much money has her campaign paid to the media for all the favors

It's dictator talk to see justice served and not made a mockery of? Ooooook...

Now I don't like trump but I thought that comment was awesome, in a kinda hilarious way.

I'm calling BS. Stop being so one sides. She. Broke. The. Law. And SHOULD be in jail.

Too bad we live in a democracy, or I'd lock him up first

wrong, just people that have lied under oath and committed perjury in front of the house

New yours times is completely a joke and is totally not worthy of respect

How can he put someone in jail? He thinks he's beyond the law!

Obama to execute Presidential Pardon for HRC on Jan 20....Not chance for Trump.

The whole performance was red meat to his base supporters.

Very disturbing. Like she said, thankfully we don't have ruthless bullies making laws here like in other countries

He should have be i jail for talking like women like you line that! Cause i do talk like that about my daughters like that!

Major difference between "putting someone in a cage" and ending the protection, through corruption, and letting justice to be served...

Don't we have prisoners who have gone to trial in Guantanamo?

She needs to have an independent counsel...let her have her day in court

If this were a third world country, he would be in jail in the next morning

She would be in jail because she would finally have to answer for her crimes, Trump would not cover it all up
The way Obama has

Could we just call it dicktalk for short? It really encompasses all of his layers.

Oh, so it's dictatorial to put criminals in jail...in my opinion both should be behind bars!

Well not really supporting Trump but... I would put them in cages...

Trump wiped the floor with that entire organized criminal family. Did it make you mad ? LOL

Putting political opponents in cages and if you don't will,what do you think would happen to you

As usual, the NYT takes everything out of context. Liberals suck.

It also wasn't his turn to speak.

Orrrrrrrrr, maybe she is a Criminal in the biggest crime family, the Clinton Cartel

I thought I knew how low the NYT would stoop. I was wrong. You hit rock bottom and then brought in the heavy equipment to keep digging.

Not political opponents in jail, but those found guilty of treason

She is a crook, and should be in jail

Que cosa ni si quiera me at atrevo a  llamarlo  hombre es s simplemente horrendo  en todo

Clinton is a criminal... she deserves to be in jail... if not release everyone in prison now...

He's awful! I'm wondering why he doesn't feel he should be in jail for sexual assault.

Retaliation to those that opposed him, sounds familiar yeah.

It is not waht he said , but then when did the NYT pay attention to truth

Not paying taxes is another criminal violation of the law, he should be in jail too. 🙄😒

They all need to be in jail for being traitors to our country end of story.

Lets appoint a special prosecutor to investigate trump

WikiLeaks has just released the first wave of  Clinton's scandalous emails, why don't you say anything to the public about it ???

He doesn't want to be president he wants to be king 
I think the early settlers of this nation fought a war to break away from a king

She should of went to jail! Y'all would of been quick to put Obama in jail if he did such a thing! Hypocrisy at its finest.

I remember Snipes doing time for three years over tax evasion. It's unfair for Trump to get off scot-free.

But those 5 words probably his best delivered punch line though.

Are you potential Trump voters finally getting it or do you want a repressive dictatorial regime?

That's not dictator talk-it would be called justice.

It is dictator talk. That's not what he said though lol.

If your moral compass in any way lets you support this individual, then I would advise throwing it in the ocean & hope to find another someday!!

The orange guy is totally out of control, I believe his sanity left him ages ago!!!!

And obummer siged the FBI and IRS on his right or do you think America has forgotten this tactic ,,, creep on going Pravda

Martha Stewart went to jail for the same issue. Last week a service member went to jail for the same thing. Use your head people.

This election can't come soon enough. If I never see or hear about The Donald ever again, it'll be too soon.

Haha! So funny!! Hillary deserves to be in jail! Good on Trump!!!

People who destroy evidence after being subpoenaed don't go to jail.... because that's not illegal .. Right?????

It's so frightening to think he would have people who would even consider voting for him.

The Office of the Special Prosecutor was eliminated during the Bush administration.

Demonisation and exageration will ultimately benefit Trump!! Is this what the NYT is trying to do?????

Love all these libs!! Can't see that she broke the law! Obstruction of Justice. She lied under oath just Like hubby

If anyone needs proof of how fast this country can deteriorate with Trump as president, all they need to do is look at what's going on in the Philippines with Duterte. They're both fruits from the same poisonous tree.

Wellllll she has broken the law. . . Lied under oath. . . Etc, etc, etc. . .

He right about putting hilary in jail it's a honest statement...

We are used to it here in Malaysia , welcome to the club. Lol

No it's the truth. Hillary belongs in jail. Period.

The Democratic Party seeks the prosecution of global warming skeptics. http://dailysignal.com/2016/04/04/16-democrat-ags-begin-inquisition-against-climate-change-disbelievers/

Eric Holder threatened to jail the Bush Administration. But that was okay, right? http://www.cnn.com/2009/POLITICS/04/22/torture.prosecution/index.html

how is it dictator talk when she should already be in jail.....?

No, he said he would put her in jail, not a cage. She's broken the law. Really your headline is nothing more than a LIE.

Haha not. He just meant the truth would be found and she would be in jail for doing the crimes she has committed.

All that trump needs is Mean Gene Okerlund to be the moderater at the next debateand he's all set!

We used to put criminals behind bars in this country. Not sure when the plan changed on that, but I missed the memo.

I'm a never trump guy but people who commit felonies usually go to jail.

I thought he said that because Clinton broke the law but used her status and power to escape the law? Not because he was going to abuse power. Wow. This is quite the spin.

Absolute propaganda lies. NYT should be shut down for false reporting.

no , you are the dictator because she and her husband belong in jail.

Anybody found to have violated any law should be expected to get reprimand according to the law. If its jail term, very good. Non above the law??

Please all be careful, if you criticize the messiah we may all end up in jail. He is checking each and every comment and making a list. That is why he is up at 3am, a ton of FB content to go thru

Trump said he has so much respect for women and always treats them with respect . Biggest crock of sh*t I've ever heard .

Now wanting to serve justice has been deemed as dictatorial???

Don the Con going the shyster shuffle, and we still don't have a tax return!!

Criminals belong in Jail.
Dont worry NYT, you and CNN will still receive your Clinton Foundation revenue.

Just so the populace knows, How many that have commented on this falsehood are Clinton employed trolls?

So only a dictator would suggest putting criminals in jail, right? LOL you guys are DESPERATE!

Exactly!! The treats alone he has made towards her is enough for her to go after him if she so chooses to.

No that's the talk of a true American lock that traitor Clinton up!

This is the logical conclusion of thirty years of the liberal-bashing industry

Or criminals because obviously our AG isn't willing to do the job

Why dont you go to hell you mut u r not fit to enter the whitehouse leave aside becoming President. Go home.

But she broke the law...am I missing something why she should not be in jail?

It's true and what a majority of Americans believe. 
The 1% commit the crimes, real Americans do the time.

Democrats and Republicans only 2 choices for the past 100 + years. Where the freedom of choice from the land of the free??

Please show the quote where he said that. Quit filling your sheep followers w BS

Maybe people should watch what was actually said. Lol the Ny time's is a joke

Smug pundits hear: “I’m a dictator in waiting.” Normal people hear, “Politicians will be treated like I would."

"I don't see any criminal thing Hillary did."- the blindest people alive

Good for him! True talk of a true leader! Killery earned this nick name by actually giving orders to KILL her 'enemies'! I think the body count around her and her also very honest husband is around 114 or so.

But it's ok for powerful people to break the law wo consequence...

dictator talk?! she lied to fbi! shed be in jail for breaking the law.

Pretty sure he said jail not a cage lol which she should be in jail

Who cares if it's an op-ed piece? Why post a post that's deliberately false?

Lol these headlines are amazing! More evidence that the media is biased. #trump

Did we forget about him paying off two AG's to drop the fraud charges? How about the case in court now from his sexual assault of a 13 year old? How about the other rape case he paid off over 100k to go away? Upstanding non-criminal you folks have at the GOP!

He did the sniffles again mic didn't work lol

Ouch! U can't defend her now so the BS starts. Scums

Does any1 throw up a lil every time u see an article from this newspaper?.....

They been using the same lies with everything for decades folks

Thats stretching it. Hillary belongs in jail. She sold weapons to isis by way of Qatar....

That's not what Trump said...You and other media are hell bent trying to defame one candidate..

If she had broken the law the REPUBLICAN majority would hav e put her on trial by now. Be real.

If anything a Special Prosecutor needs to look into Trump's connections to Communist Bank of China. How did it come about that Trump owes Red China 650 million dollars?

Il Trump Duche Scumbag the III

That wasn't the context in which it was said. Twisting the story to suit yourself. Bad journalist.

Could you guys be anymore ridiculous? He said that if he was in charge Hilary would be in prison for the crimes she committed. He never once said that he would put his political opponents in prison.

Jailing opponents and political dissidents and generals....making America great 
????? For who...Putin

Prajesh Bhatia bc how is this dictator talk Matlab kuch bhi

And she would, because the cow is a serious felonious criminal.  Funny how you dont seem to know that.

Soon he will be in jail!

Donald Trump look like a creepy weirdo the way he was walking around Hillary he is a jealous bully.

Most childish adult I have ever seen on TV. Worse than Kanye West.

Hillary and bill destroyed those women. 

I think we need to help these women. Just think about carrying those scars throughout your life. I'm a male but dam it look at these women. It's just not right. 😥

The electoral system seems to be powerless in dealing with mad people.

Ohhh so now enforcing the law is being a dictator, haha! democrats are so desperate.

He'd be putting a war criminal to justice - FINALLY. No different from Nuremburg.

Lol... you gotta be kidding me?

Shes a pathological criminal... thats why she would be in jail

Oh get over it nyt....its like ur trying to convince five year olds

Oh are you insane, you actually want to elect an dictator? Throw all that your country's founders have created?

Deplorable con man has no clue how our government and legal system works.

oh shut up... he said that if he was a prosecutor with all info wikileaks reveal she would be in jail

The Queen of the Flies finally had to face the truth and it hurt her badly.

Of course a true dictator just calls for drone strikes against anyone who gets in her way...

Yes, it is dictator talk. And he was rude, interrupted time and time again. The moderators had to stop him several times.

I've said for the past 6 months that Trump isn't running for President; he's running for dictator.

What he says and what he can really do are two totally different things. People seem to be losing sight that we are electing a president,not a king.

This happened in Egypt/Taiwan; why not USA , if Hillary really committed crime; no matter you like US legal system or not😆

Thug Trump wants to sexually assault women or lock them up. More assault tapes are coming out.

No, it's not. Her being a political rival had nothing to do with what he said.

There is suppose to be arms length between president and AG... That is third world speak , like Putin who put his opponent in jail .

The New York Times is a government sanctioned propaganda spewing corporate welfare taking corrupted organization. Has not told the truth about much since before 9/11/2001. Shameful. Never Hillary. Never Trump.

Hillary is a criminal. If you can't see that, you are the problem!

I hope Trump remembers that he can't save his own house by trying to set other people's houses on fire
Get Trump Nope T-Shirt : https://goo.gl/XrTTDL

Wrong! He will put her in gail because she leaked confidential emails and is so corrupted

I think we all agree that the NYT clearly favour the Clinton camp.

She does belong in prison along with her slime husband while Trump belongs in an insane asylum.

It got a good laugh though,in this Clown show.

No, he would uphold the law and actually hold criminals accountable. If she is guilty, she should face the music just like any of us.

She broke law. She should be in jail. There are people in jail now for mishandling classified material like she did.

WAR STARTS WITH PROPAGANDA.

You are witnessing a huge propaganda machine that is leading us into WWIII. Trump said he wanted to end the endless cycle of wars. Before we went into Iraq General Wesley Clark was told we had plans to go to war with 7 countries including Iraq and Syria. Obama has a working relationship with the Muslim Brotherhood and  Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Turkey. These are  Hillary's Clintons Foundations biggest funders including those who support the European Union inside the Ukraine. The Muslim Brotherhood had meetings with Obama in the Whitehouse and with the Muslim Brotherhood our government took down the Egyptian government replacing it with a Muslim Brotherhood government. The Arab Spring was an Obama Muslim Brotherhood construct to remove non fundamentalist rulers.

General William Boykin, Admiral Lyons, Frank Gaffney assistant director of defense under Reagan, Lt colonel Tony Shaffer, Pulitzer prize winner Seymour Hersh, CIA intelligence specialist Clair Lopez, Andrew McCarthy who prosecuted the blind sheik, all believe that at Benghazi we switched sides on the war on terror and the Muslim Brotherhood has infiltrated every level of our Government. When Lt colonel Tony Shaffer asked the Egyptian Minister of defence what CIA director John Brennan said when he asked him if America will help purge the rest of the Muslim Brotherhood from Egyptian government, the minister said John Brennan laughed in his face. The Egyptian people have distain for Obama, his half brother and Hillary, for working with the Muslim Brotherhood terrorists.

Benghazi was a gun running operation to run weapons from Qatar to Libya and Syria. Non sharia rulers. An operation that would use hard line salifists supported by Saudi Arabia to take down non fundamentalist Muslim rulers in Libya and Syria.  Follow the money from the Clinton Foundation in relationship to the regime changes around the world. Our government and the Clinton Foundation is in collusion for regime change and gun running which has killed tens of thousands maybe more. Hillary cannot be indicted because there is no rule of law right now and the Clinton Foundation can take down the government and start wars. Trump will take down the government that is why Republican establishment and Democrats and the media controlled through the CIA is doing everything they can to make sure he does not become president. He is up against the entire NWO and it will take a miracle for him to become president and do what he needs to do. The brain washing started back in the 60' s with literalism, secular humanism than political correctness to keep you blind. The ego is your worse enemy that is easily used against you with words like conspiracy theory...

Our government, after setting up a huge propaganda machine in which the media controlled by only 6 major groups, is complicit in the NWO objectives first brought out by George Bush senior and is  about to go to war with Russia. Obama is setting it up, if Hillary wins it is assured.

Our government never left the cold world mentality. Syria needs to be taken down in order to have a natural gas pipeline running through Syria under a government controlled by the World Bankers. Very few wars start without World Bank approval. Seymour Hersh believes the sarin gas attack on children in Syria was not done by Assad but part of the propaganda machine for us to go into Syria planned by the State Department, Qatar , Saudi Arabia and Turkey. Multiple sources have proved that the sarin did not even come from Assads supply our sanctions on Syria not known to the public are killing tens of thousands. Collateral damage is being exploded to make it look like Assad is killing his own people. Russia is supporting Christians We are supporting hard line salifists who are cutting their heads off. We are learning more and more through leaks and Judicial FOIA requests about how Obama after receiving intelligence reports about how Al Qaida in Iraq was going to develop, let it develop and supported it through agreements with secondary sources who funded and supplied it as it grew and developed into ISIS. General Flynn validated the FOIA releases proving that Obama's position against Syria led to the purposeful creation of ISIS built from Al Qaida in Iraq so that a force can be established to take down Assad.

Obama admitted to involvement in the Ukraine coup. Before the coup polls showed strong support for Russia and the president who supported Russia. Ambassador Nuland put in place by Hillary, McCain and NATO organized the coup on the Ukrainian president. McCain also illegally entered Syria through Turkey to organize the salifists in Syria.

The Ukrainian president was against the European trade agreements that will unite with TPP and was friendly with Russia so he needed to be removed. With every one if these regime changes comes untold death and destruction.

 NATO, Obama, and the world Bankers wanted offensive weapons against Russia on Ukrainian soil. Russia anticipated this and took the Crimea which is also strongly pro Russian. 

If Russia supports Syria and protects its security interests they are aggressors, when we do it we are defending freedom. A huge propaganda machine has been established to support the narrative. Almost all wars start with propaganda. If we go to war with Russia, our military will be used to support the goals of the NWO while Russia will be fighting against the NWO.

What is right is wrong what is up is down. All the world's a stage. Pray for the soul of America to wake up.

She will push to destroy the supreme court, increase the propaganda war against Russia to the point we go to WWIII On the wrong side of the battle. Increase immigration by a million Muslims in order to fulfill the Soros directive in order to cause insurrection and economic collapse. Response from citizens to fatwas called by the mosques to go to war will lead to fighting Islam door to door as Germans are coming close to doing. This will lead to implementation of the executive orders Obama has put in place for a federalized police state under United Nations control which is where Obama will probably go next. She will pass TPP which unites with the European trade agreements and agenda 21 and crisis response will lead to single payer under government control finishing up controlling all aspects of our lives. Civil war will lead to death beyond imagination, the Muslim Brotherhood controlled DHS has billions of rounds of ammunition. Patriots are already all over the Homeland security threat list. Most life needs resources will be controlled and used for control. The resistance will be overcome despotism will be the rule and despotism leads blind sheep to accept any shepherd.

November 9 , 2016: President elect Trump just announced he'll will prosecute Hillary Clinton , Mitt Romney , Rosie O'Donnell , Alex Baldwin, Ted Cruz , Michael Bloomberg

the NYT just another liberal rag, everyone knows Hillary broke the law

I have the feeling it is he who will be going to jail.

Sorry mr trump you dont have any leadership qualities,you can only be president in your dreams.

And people cheered. I was appalled by this!!!!!!

prison or been executed by mercenary like orlando he is a very progressive man

No, he said he'd put Hillary Clinton in jail, for very specific unethical things she's been accused of that a lot of people still think she's guilty of. That's not dictatorial, that's legal, that's applying the law as he sees it

That is simply not true- Why post things he did not say? He said he would appoint a person to look into clinton and her many crimes. Which should have been done long ago.

Dny times, what idiots. He did NOT say that. He said hillary would be in jail as is all the others that mishandled classified info. What a blatant lie

Hm Tera post dekh bhi nahi rahe hai aur tum chhape jaa rahe ho chhape jaa rahe ho pata nahi Kya.. saans lo saans..naak mei mat ghuso mere..

He obviously has no idea how democracy works.

What a creep.

Trump's campaign is over.

He reminds me of Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev at the end of his reign when he was simply unable to understand the reality. His family confirmed many times that Brezhnev wanted to retire but the political leadership of the Soviet Union did not allow him to go as they were able to do whatever they wanted. There are many advantages when the political leader is unable to understand the reality. His team decides, his team makes decisions, and his team can hide themselves and claim themselves victims of injustice and incompetence. I think now you understand those who aggressively defend him. They don't care about him. He is just a means to realize their true goals. To some extend Trump is a victim of all those who claim themselves his supporters. Later on he will be blamed and his supporters will come out of water dry.
When you grow on toxic environment of hatred and insult you cannot a a sweet fruit no matter hard you try to shine.
It is so funny to imagine him at the negotiations. The best thing he can do is be silent. When an uninformed person tries to express opinions it is at least funny and at most stupid. 
We admire former presidents and most of the time we don't care about their party affiliation. When you decide to vote think if you would like to repeat their ideas and accept them as role models. For me President is more than a person sitting in the White House. He is a symbol of intelligence the country has, fairness the protection of its policies, consistency of moral and democratic principles, generosity, forgiveness and support the country guarantees. And finally, I want not to be ashamed when my children repeat whatever the President of this great country says.
P.S. Dear Trump supporters, you might disagree with me but do not practice your insulting and vulgar vocabulary. I have no intention to fight with you.

DESPERATION TIME NEW YORK TIMES.... LET THE LIES CONTINUE....NO ONE BELIEVES YOU ANY MORE... SUCH LOSERS....

The applause and cheers startled me and made me sad

U guys are in the same league.CNN Sandwich

Why I think NYT is helping Trump😂

An embarrassing crossing of an ethical line, NYT.

If you commit a crime you belong in jail .. No matter who you are .

That's Kim Jong Un talk...

That's also desperation from someone losing a debate.

It's so funny how the media flips and switches words.

Tru💩p is unfit, the smart folks read the NY Times

Go away, New York Times

Vladimir Trump has spoken



I hope this surprised no one.

Most disturbing thing he said tonight.

Trump should be in prison

How much money Clinton foundation poured into your accounts ?#thenewyorktimes .

Taking after his buddy Putin

Would that be presidents veto right?

Putin is his friend.

And he in a hospital for crazy people.

Ny Times Bought and paid for by Libtards!!!!

Trump step down. 
Gary Johnson step in.
#letgarydebate

Can't wait for the next SNL

He said he'd put Hillary in JAIL.

The US press (NY Times) have lies in Vietnam, Irak, and lies, lies, .....

have fun reading the NY TIMES #1984 #sheeple

the integrity of journalism in 2016 in dreadful. shame on the nytimes.

I think Donald Trump will win

Totally.  NeverTrump

He is a psychopath.

She broke the law that's why.

New York Times you're a joke

NY times what a rag

That's hillary's crimes

No. . . just no NY Times.

Let trump become the U.S president !
America will see its demise.

TOTAL LIES BY THE NEW YORK TIMES.... NYT = CLINTON OPERATIVES

That's not what he said! Another disgusting lie by The NY Times

He never said cages. She should be in jail.

No that is called justice for Criminal activity

False statement New York Times.

Fascism 101

He talked about ISIS drowning people in steel cages.

Show me where in the debate he said that.

We agree that it was "dictator talk"...

Hahahajahah.......NYTimes shitting in ur pants



You don't take him seriously, and then you take him seriously.

https://youtu.be/DgxZr6LLS34

I believe you can be jailed for sexual assault, too.  Grabbing a woman by her private parts, whether your are a star or otherwise, is a crime.  What a terrible example for America's children this guy is.

And what about not paying taxes?

He would assign a special prosecutor.  To the me the New York Times has lost credibility in its coverage of this election.  You can't just take things totally out of context.  So biased and not fact based.

I guess the NYT has no been paying attention...

How ridiculous of the NYTimes to twist his statement! It is deplorable of the  NYTimes! Why don't you just close up shop? You can't even communicate in the English language. Why don't you hire a conservative who is in touch with the real world who can act as a translator for you since you are out of touch with reality which is really bad for a newspaper and you so obviously need a translator. Have you absolutely no ethics, NY Times?

Dana Bash: “What Makes This Country Different From Countries With Dictators” Is That “They Put Their Opponents In Jail”

NY Times - you are utterly devoid of any shred of journalistic integrity or neutrality. No reasonable person  takes you seriously. You are a farce and have become a caricature of yourselves.

All this talk about in the gutter and ugly night by liberal tabloids and some mainstream also liberal sounds to me like ...

Well done Mr. Trump... Well Done...stick a fork in her, Clinton is well done....  who won

Trump did.

The fly took second place.

For most Americans, if you get a subpoena, then delete 30,000 emails, you would go to jail for destroying evidence.  

For most Americans, if you send top secret info on your personal email, you would at minimum lose your security clearance, but likely you would go to jail.  

Saying that your DOJ would prosecute someone who has committed crimes isn't being a dictator.  Now giving her a free pass like the Obama DOJ?  That is favoritism similar to that of a dictatorship.

It isn't dictator talk.  She'd be in jail because the FBI would've actually done their job.  If Hillary wasn't being primed to be the Dem candidate I guarantee she'd have been in jail.

Such dishonesty from the New York Times.  The Left has proven during this election cycle that they will ignore the context of a statement whenever it suits them to do so.

No a dictator is obummer's unprecedented amount of vetoes.  Dictator talk is a president denying Christianity and trying to kill it all while promoting another religion that was never a founding religion of this country! A dictator and criminal is Hillary and Obama!

If we had a just tax system, these narcissistic oligarchs wouldn't exist.  Our infatuation with irrational wealth has given us this trumpocystem. Change the tax system so that no one with an American passport can possess that kind of money.

Typical media sensationalism.  He said he'd put someone that about 50% of the country give or take believes should be in jail, in jail.  Don't try to spin that into what it's not, I thought the Times would be better than that

That's not what he actually said, or meant.  Clearly what he meant was that she wouldn't retain the political based immunity that she's been using with such great effect to avoid being prosecuted for being criminally negligent any longer.

Tabloid journalism .. Watch the debated

Scary scary man if you can call him a  man I don't.  Normalizing criminal behavior as locker room talk is disgusting and shows he doesn't even realize how demeaning he is to women.  Clueless wonder needs to go back to the dark ages.  This man is a menace to society.

Can't say it better than Andrew Midgett: "there was an official investigation by the FBI, and she was cleared of criminal charges.  that's legal.  but the president ordering the AG to prosecute a political opponent after she was cleared?  that's like a third world country"

#TrumpForPrison

Nice spin The New York Times - but not true.  He said he's open up a special investigation on Hillary Clinton, which is what the American people deserve after the Obama helped her cover her tracks.  She's a criminal who got off due to her connections and power.

What it means is he would make the DOJ do their job instead of allowing them to aid and abet someone under criminal investigation.   The heads of those two departments need placed in prison even faster than her.

Go ahead and feed more lies to your head in the sand readers and Hillary supporters.  Go ahead and elect her so she can attack and smear more of Bill's rape victims too.  It's sad how there's so much focus on what Trump said but the video of Hillary laughing about destroying a 12 year old girl who was a rape victim of someone she represented never gets much attention.

Why yes, it is.

Very Saddam Hussein like.

What's he going to do with the GOP?

That's not dictator talk that is the TRUTH

That got me laughing breathless hahahahaha

I hate this man he's a pig

Really wants to set up a DICTATORSHIP .... not gonna happen!

Lie, Lie, Lie. For once in your professional opinion tell the truth.

Dictators jail their political opponents.

Chavez and Maduro showed him the way.

At least he doesn't pose like a dictator.

Talked like a dictator

All Trump needs is to wear an arm band.

His authoritarian leanings and admiration for strongman dictators has been on display throughout the campaign. He fundamentally doesn't understand how our political system works. He thinks he can just say a thing and the entire political system and everyone in it will comply. Recall him saying if he told the military to waterboard people, they'd do it, believe him. He'd take another nation's oil. He'd force other countries to pay for things he wants done. This is part deranged dictator and part delusional mobster talk. His routine attacks on anyone who criticizes him, including saying he'll change libel laws to allow anyone to sue the press for printing unflattering articles is an affront to our republic. His regular attack line that Clinton could have fixed everything in her time in public service comically displays his ignorance.  

Putting his political opponents in jail is precisely what we should expect him to say.

Only in a banana republic....

Putting his political opponents in jail is what dictators do.

He a Stupid man and it showed last two debates

Fascist old tweaker

This is so biased, shame on you nyt.



What crap.  The FBI Director says she's guilty and that he didn't indict because she's too stupid to know that what she did was wrong.  And that she didn't know that lying to the FBI and Congress was illegal.  ANY person with a shred of integrity would be calling for her to be in jail, regardless of political ideology.

I can't stand the guy but that's some solid spin.

3rd world dictators use this same rhetoric

If he puts Killary behind bars then he has my vote.

Better than putting them in the ground.

Trump presidente!!!

This would be against U.S. constitution.

Oh, you're a nutty propaganda machine NYT.

Not even close to what he said. NYT is filled with fucktards

I'm not a Trump fan...but that's not what he said.

Is official the media r supporting Hillary.

Trump sees himself as a dictator.  If he says go/do torture,  troops must obey. If Trump contradicts the Constitution,  then it must be changed. He is a wannabe oligarch.  :-(

I finally lost all my respect for the NYT.

#ImWithHer

This man is utterly unfit to run for president.

He is Isis with his creepy look!

WELL HILLARY HAS EVADED JUSTICE SHE BELONGS IN PRISON

she did the crime she should do the time

Straight out of the Vladimir Putin playbook

he is done. el fin. finito.

but clinton is a criminal and where do criminals end up?

Politics is a way to organize and/or repress hatreds.

Oh, so now you realize this?? The man is off of his nut.

He forgot to goose-step.

i am sick to my stomach i am so scared for america

they both need to step down for America

He just being REAL....not puppet

Trump said he would put Hillary in jail for her violations of the law and would appoint a special prosecutor to investigate why no charges were brought, Bill's meeting with the AG, and the FBI director's ties to the Clintons. This is how a republic works. People are feed up with the unequal enforcement of the law.  The FBI director even said that if anyone else did what Hillary did they would be prosecuted and some already have.

Making Fascism fashionable.

Well that's one way to spin a headline.

America this makes you look embarrassing!

He doesn't get to apply the law 'as HE sees it.'  🙄

Nut case!

Shes not above the law. But she has so many rich powerful friends she is

I agree

So when is he going to jail for raping minors?

Don't forget he'd also restrict the media.

He should be in a cage with Bill Cosby.

The NYT started using cus words on their front page, and now are  lying about an exchange that Trump clearly won. The old grey lady had turned into a tramp with a see through dress.  The NYT is on the brink of extinction as a newspaper. These are their last desperate breaths.

That was the best statement  of the night.

Hillary: No crimes. No indictments. No arrests. No convictions.

It's absurd the bias of headlines like this one.

Great choice Racist Trump or Benghazi killer

NYT blatantly desperate and in full on joke mode

That was the best line from the whole thing.

Good some of these politicians belong in jail for selling us out!

Funny how saying Hillary would be in prions is now a statement that he is going to imprison everyone who does not agree with hims.  BUT THEN SHILLING FOR HILLARY AND BILLIONS OF OUR TAX DOLLARS IS YOUR MAIN OBJECTIVE.

He said he would put Hillary Clinton in jail!!!

Spoken like a true soviet!

Not sure about the 'tator" part, but he sure is a "dic"

He is sick. Never Trump

not if you are talking to congenital criminals

This comment is a far stretch.

That's what I said!

You trump supporters have no respect for yorselves

Dump the Trash Trump

Dump Tru💩p!

this paper always has it wrong

Dangerous, egotistic, icky man.

NYT is as desperate as Hillary.

Don't cry bully this. What a bunch of losers.

More garage from the NYT! Don't lie like Killary!

That man enraged me so much.

Ummm no that's not what he said why are you.lying?

YOU LYING C*NTS,  HE NEVER SAID THAT AT ALL.

What?  The American people think Trump won.  The media is making a fool of itself.  Why don't you go back to unbiased journalism.  #makejournalismgreatagain

...banana republic, third world nation talk?

One sided media. Do not subscribe any longer.

You're reaching....

#BoycottNYT.  Libtards.

Hillary Clinton was cleared of all criminal charges according to the Justice system.  The argument is that the justice system is broken because it didn't send Hillary to jail. Yet when it comes to police brutality against minorities, the same people that want Hillary in jail say the system works. You can't have it both ways. If you want minorities to accept the judgment of the judicial system,  so do you. Hillary was cleared of all criminal charges. Accept it and move on.  Just because an obese bigoted sexual deviant liar like Trump says different does not make it right.

an inferior man with the complex an added extra

Stop being so Bias Media. It's not working

Whatever!! He said she would go to jail!! If convicted

BS

Bull! She would be in jail simply because she is a criminal-

He is not well

Kind of.  I can't really get excited about this seeing how aggressively Hillary has criticized Snowden and Manning for offenses she herself committed and will never be punished for.  Once again, America's most loathsome troll is the only one speaking a basic truth.  Wake up!  There is a reason  people who are disgusted by the ruling class, in their desperation, find hideous toad trump appealing.

agree. as she did the wrong ...that may have endanger the nation

Scary-- the new Stalin?

(scarier was that people in the audience cheered)

Yikes!

He should be in jail now and not running for president

Es un pendejo

I am with you Trump make sure she never get out

Hideous man!

http://youtu.be/kSE-XoVKaXg

He is demented and an embarrassment to the US.

That's sad how CNN accept Trump threat Hillary at this time 😡😡

Acts like a dictator. Talks like a dictator. Admires dictators. Gets followers lathered and foaming at the mouth like a dictator.. Would rule like a dictator.  Mercy.

I don't think it is dictator talking; it's justice.

He puts himself into the grave

Not at all what was said.

That's exactly what I said last night

He is just a dic.

First and foremost the republicans have already wasted taxpayers money on investigation and hearing and Hillary has been cleared of any and all allegations.  For trump to say this he is acting as if this country is about to elect a dictator.   He is totally wrong.  He is unethical unfit candidate.   I'm with her.  She has character.  She has been fighting for Americans for 30 years.  She is bipartisan champion.  Vote blue.  Vote blue

#DemagogueDonnie #DictatorDonnie #DerangedDonnie

Political competitors being put in jail is a threat and action followed by the DICTATORS of Germany, Russia, Korea.  So now the GOP, party of so called  "Constitutional " government, wants to throw out the Constitution and go to a Dictatorship?  "The law as he sees it"....that's the problem, HE DOES NOT KNOW THE LAWS or the Constitution.









Even the 4th Reich will need an SS

Awesome

Criminals belong in jail. Period.

That's not what he said

Exactly what Puttin has said and does!!

He needs psychiatric help. Badly.

He did not say that Jesus the press lies as much as Hillary.

You were only off by five letters.

NYT is a total JOKE!!!!

Very scary stuff!

Shmuck

and what about his scams? -shouldn't he be in jail?

How much is Hillary Clinton paying you guys?

Because she is a criminal.

And she will have veto power.



The justice system is irrelevant to Trump. So.....

He did a great job

He stalked her like a predator.

get Hillary and Soro's behind bars ASAP

...except that it's not what he said.

She broke the law. She's supposed to be in jail

He did not say cage he said jail

That's what they do in communist countries!!!!

I have started to think this has to be some sort of social experiment the government is conducting..  I mean really, Trump??  He's nuts!!

He was NOT attacked by the eagle!!!

Cue Trump trolls. 🙄

That's not what he said.

Arrogance and ignorance of the judicial process....

Weird

http://www.sharefortrump.com/node/1533?a=12464

Corporate dictators are better right?

My role model is Putin.

You are more on the dull side of things, I gather...

Putin. Castro. Trump.

Deranged.

Where she belongs.

Trump dictator talk !

More liberal media B$.

Bwhahahahahahaaa...No Thats justice Talk!!!!



Political opponent, no but criminal, yes.

#busted

he will declare martial law.elect him and watch.

No that's treating criminals like they deserve

He said that what Isis is doing way are you lieing

Of course he would !

Welcome to Trump's banana republic

Hillary Clinton is deplorable

Family Clinton are criminal ... Clinton USA bombed Serbia against UN permitions

That is a media twist

Just a thought he should be in jail I bet he's got a lot to hide!

Your reporting sucks

He scared me silly with that remark.

Twist words much?

>> oh what a circus -- Trump can NOT be our next POTUS ...

He is the alpha baboon.

Start with her then bankers

All those oppose him will be jailed

Jail not cage .😆

He is dangerous people

What Trump was snoring?

Scary

Because shes  a criminal

Turn him off, shut this lunatic down

If anyone actually believes that killary is innocent,  they have to be on crack. Many people have done much less and have been prosecuted.

Here, here, the dictator speaks!

So letting her break the law as doing nothing about it is OK simply because of her politics power?  The law applies equally to all Americans.  I personally think she Shoukd face the death penalty.  Her corruption and evil is too dangerous for a prison cell.

Dictactor talking😡

i just cant get enough of this vedio clip

Hehehehe if only...... He would be president

Trump is scum.

NYT in damage control mode...

He is going to be Bernie Madoff's room mate

You're a disgrace and a moron

Who put him to jail for not paying the taxes

Silly

ala- Duterte of the Philippines when he talks.

He's an idiot

Misleading media...again.

Cage .... leash..... either one !

Go Trump.

THIS IS LAME

Is it?

Nope he didn't

This is actually a lie NYT biased af smh

She deserves to be in jail.

Are you kidding me?

You guys are so biased. Complete ignorance.

#GaryJohnson2016

Deplorable-Disgraceful 🐖

biased as always NYT's

Oh please !!!

wow, really? GFYs NYT

Go Trump/Pence. You got this!

Scary dictator threats

Does the NYT ever fact checks themselves?

Lol. Just Hillary because she said Abraham Lincoln taught her how to lie

Hey Trump! That''s Duterte's line!

#GaryJohnson

He may win this, what a terrifying thought.

Want to make an easy 5,000 bucks by telling the truth?

Oh this is ridiculous

Trump won !!!!

Clearly said "Jail"

She is a Criminal 😝🤔

this man is really out of control! i can´t stand him!

HILARY SHOULD 100% BE IN JAIL.

Maybe he can be put in jail for income tax evasion.

No he didn't

Corrupt establishment corporate media propaganda

Dictator Trump, NEVER lol

#KILLARYFORPRISON👹👹👹

If his administration treated everyone alike, Hillary would be in jail.  Justice is not ruled by politicos giving special favors to people in high places!

A jail is a cage.

https://youtu.be/xKOQdcVoRys



Yes, he speaks like a dictator but not in this case.  She's broken multiple laws (laws for which other-poorer- people are sent to jail).  If she weren't so wealthy she'd already be there.

trump is putin. No less. His violent talk and the violent talk of his supporters are not the words of the people of a  democracy  but of a dictatorship.

That's justice.

or in his case "dicktator"

Trump should be in jail for sexual assault.

This is America 2016. What a circus.

he is unfit to be a UNITED STATE president.he is rude..

Only the crooked ones, and Killary is one of them

He will never become a president.

He should be in jail for ever

Stop this man NOW!

He didn't say political opponents or cages.  He said Hillary should be put in jail.  And that's where she belongs!  NYT twisting the facts again to fit their agenda!

Welcome to the dark ages.

Hillary belongs in jail

Shut up liberal media

No that is justic . YOU DO THE CRIME YOU DO THE TIME.

Well, republicans are pro dictator?

He would put corrupt politicians in jail yes!

Media hype. He did not say candidates - he addressed Hillary

Speechless. Beyond sad.

He will grab and grope...

What nonsence . He merely insisted on justice .

That's why Putin and Trump are best friends.

As if there is democracy in US.

He is just crazy.

He is right !!!

What's so "shocking"? She should have been in jail already.

That's not what he said.

Good! Lock her up! Hillary for PRISON.

He and Putin are very eerily similar.

Sorry didn't hear him say that

You are kidding me?

That's a Big IF !!😂

Where did he say that?

That's a big fat lie.

Frightening

Deplorable

haha she deserves

Only Rosie O'Donnell :P

Idiot liberals.

The Deviant Donald reminds me of Stanley Kozlowski from        "A Street Car Named Desire."  Trump's supporters do as well.  They, however, are so uneducated that they've yet to comprehend that HRC is no Blanche DuBois.  HRC is the next President of the United States.  Madame President, November 8th will be one of the greatest days in American history, and in my life.  Thank you.

Trump is hope for America & the American people.  For almost 20 years it's been the Bush & Clinton families. America needs change & to get rid of corruption in government.  Trump 2016

Horse hockey.Not true NY.Post....





#johnsonweld

HILLARY IS NOT ABOVE THE LAW.

Like pol pot. Or Stalin. Or Pinochet. Lovely.

Idiot

GO TRUMP ! US ! US !

And that is SPINNNNNN

FFS he's an American hero enjoy my unfollow

Good.  Her untouchable status is indicative of her elitist position; something you'd expect in a communist nation.  She is a felon walking the streets.

🙄

😡

He's telling it like it is!  Along with the FBI.  They all belong is prison.  It's the law for you and I, but not for the Obama Administration and the Clinton gang.  What makes them above the law?   MONEY.

Hahahhahahahahahaahhaahhahahahahahahshahshshshhshs

yep

Mad 😰😰😰

Morons

Yep

Why isn't Trump in jail?

🙄

HAHAHAHA #LockHerUp

No, he just means that the rule of law should be enforced.  If any of us did what Hillary did we would be rotting in a cell.

NYT can't be more DISHONEST, can you???

The NYT is being bias

No,  he actually said he'd put Hillary Clinton in jail, for very specific unethical things she's been accused of that a lot of people still think she's guilty of.

not really...that s justice!

He said, Hillary, not political opponents. :D :D

Liar you are

New York slime MISREPORTING again

GOOD !!!!!

DEFINITION OF HARSMENT  (BULLYING ) IN USA IS ACTING OR ACTION BY WORDS, BODY LANGUAGE OR THREAT OF ANY KIND YOU FELT DURING ALL DEBATE  YES OR NO  ?. END OF STORY  ?

God you Americans have a huge problem and it isn't the woman

That's where they belong.  And hopefully NY Times will go right behind them.

Dictator Donald Felicia Red

The New York Times  If you're going to quote Trump, get it right!  You're lying to the public.

That's not dictator talk.  That's putting a criminal behind bars for lawful reasons. Go die nytimes

Tim Tim Walkoe

So do the Republicans who always talk about liberty and freedom and the constitution want a dictator?  That's as scary as Trump talking like one.

What an unamerican thing to say 😡

He is a disgrace as a Human Being

The great American Dictator

That's his predilection; he wants to be dictator.  Shut t DOWN
VOTE VOTE VOTE
STRONGER TOGETHER
VOTE BLUE

correction...he said he would put CRIMINALS in JAIL !!  Trump for President !!

In Australia watching the debate. What's with Trumps endless sniffing. I think his next visit will be to Betty Ford not the White House.  C'mon America you can do better then this goose.

That's a bit of a stretch.  And we wonder why people no longer trust the media.

He would be a dictator if he ever carried out what he said he would do.  I do not want a dictator for this country. Never!

Trump is such a Idiot he don't know he
  Is the person who needs 2 be JAIL
PRAYING FOR ALL

Well he better try Bush, Cheney
 and Rumsfeld for war crimes and for destroying economy!  How quickly people forget!

Bill  Clinton is a perpetrator, Hillary the enabler, Trump the groper. Nothing good can come from this election.

WE DO NOT JAIL OUR POLITICAL OPPONENTS IN THIS COUNTRY.  It is indeed "dictator talk".  Trump and everyone who thinks this is ok needs to read the Constitution.

The times will be out of business by the end of the next term.  Good ridden

What bs.  Soros must be giving you lots of money for the lies you are telling

Non Sense, He refereed to a Special Prosecutor, Yellow Journalism NYT's  in the tank for HRC.

Trump said there would be special prosecutors.  What a concept - EQUAL APPLICATION OF THE LAW.

God, he's such a narcissistic idiot!  How can he have supporters? How?

She should be in jail, 100 times over.  He speaks truth.

She acts presidential   He's not even close.

Normal rule applies.  If he says it about someone else, should really be applied to him.

Dictator talk, huh, NYT?  I think the Iran Deal is real dictator talk.  
They talk about Texas seceding from the Union? Maybe NYC should start first.  Your publication is a disgrace.  Goebbels would be proud of your entire organization, speaking of dictators:

https://unitedwithisrael.org/opinion-when-the-new-york-times-is-for-the-birds/

The did say he would put her in jail.  Now how about we prosecute him how sexual assult. And put him in jail.

He never said that.  Nice try though.  You librards are pathetic.   Panic much?  Lmao

Indeed.  Trump seems clueless about due process.  His arrogance is the Achilles heel.

Liars.  Lying for the corrupt crony socialist Soros that pulls your strings.

He got off a 'zinger'. Unfortunately, we are not 12 years old, and this is the WORLD STAGE.  You are unfit to be president.

Trump Nailed her!  I'm not with her!

Martha Stewart went to jail for far, far less.                                                      Grow up and face the facts, people.                                                    Hillary Clinton is a swamp snake.

Dictator mentality.  Trump will take revenge for his personal gain if he ever comes into power

Sounds like a dictator.  Watch out Mainstream media

Can't wait for The November  election 
To exercise my civic duty 🌸😂💫

We are not electing a saint. We are electing someone with the guts to take back this country. Over the last 30 years it has been overrun by globalist working with the world Bankers to destroy sovereign nations and borders. Hundreds of thousands have died. We are now on the Brink of World War 3 because of a propaganda war against Russia and Assad. Ukraine did not want to sign onto the European trade agreements, the result was a coup in which the globalist Obama led. There is only one chance to take back this country. You have been lied to on a massive scale. Man's worse enemy is his ego that will always be used against him. The media run by only 6 major groups is fully involved. They have lost all credibility removing the facade in their attempt to take down Trump who will expose the lies of regime changes around the world and the collusion with the Clinton Foundation regime change machine that is a giant octopus with tentacles through out the government Banking Industry, foreign hostile governments and media...yes conspiracy is real wake up! If you do not you will wake up without a Constitution. 

The media and Hillary dropped the Billy Bush video on Trump which they had prepared, in order to take the focus off the Wikileaks email release on Goldman Sachs speeches speeches that prove Hillary will pass TPP and so so much more.

I am not voting for Trump because he says stupid stuff or I have a false since of his life,  I am voting for Trump to save our Constitution.

"  Hillary Clinton Said Her Dream Is A Hemispheric Common Market, With Open Trade And Open Markets. *“My dream is a hemispheric common market, with open trade and open borders, some time in the future with energy that is as green and sustainable as we can get it, powering growth and opportunity for every person in the hemisphere.” [05162013 Remarks to Banco Itau.doc, p. 28] *Hillary Clinton Said We Have To Have A Concerted Plan To Increase Trade; We Have To Resist Protectionism And Other Kinds Of Barriers To Trade. *“Secondly, I think we have to have a concerted plan to increase trade already under the current circumstances, you know, that Inter-American Development Bank figure is pretty surprising. There is so much more we can do, there is a lot of low hanging fruit but businesses on both sides have to make it a priority and it's not for governments to do but governments can either make it easy or make it hard and we have to resist, protectionism, other kinds of barriers to market access and to trade and I would like to see this get much more attention and be not just a policy for a year under president X or president Y but a consistent one.” [05162013 Remarks to Banco Itau.doc, p. 32]"

Of The 12 Signatory Countries That Are Parties To TPP, 3 Gave Between $6 And $15 Million To The Clinton Foundation. At Least 4 Lobbyists Who Are Actively Lobbying For TPP Passage Have Raised More Than $800,000 For Her

Poor  Malania, she got old, dirty and abusive all in one rich husband.  Trump is a true definition of "filthy" rich!

This would not make America great again.  It would make America a third world country.

Almost all high ranking politicians should be jailed.  And their white privileged rapist sons.

America.  A third world country? I hope not.

Tsk, tsk.  Further evidence that he knows nothing about how our legal system works.  He just blabs on and on.

She violated federal rules and regulations which could have potentially jeopardized national security and lied about it.  People have been vilified and jailed for far less.

Mr. Trump, this isn't a reality TV show. It's a presidential debate. You are showing once again that you are temperamentally unfit for the office.  Trump Nope: https://goo.gl/XrTTDL

Jack A$$ that's what dictators do.  In case you haven't noticed, we live in a democracy!!!  What a moron you are!!!

I am Muslim and I am a Supporter of Trump.Cuz this is the man who will start civil war between CIA and politics. I really like this man. Please support Trump for the sake of World.   World war is coming

That statement is not true.  That is not journalism

He will set up a special investigation team on Hillary.  This man went so low. Shame on those women who agreed to be used as tools.

And sadly  he got applause for saying it

It sure is dictator talk.  Terrifying.

Hillary SUCKS terribly !!! She seems not hungry for the job. She cannot attack Trump. She fails again and again to take Trump & his serial lying, racism, sexism head on.She cannot defend the email, despite there is no violation & let Trump's accusation appear standing. She basically sucks as debater or as a campaigner. It seems she takes it for granted that she would be the automatic president. Her campaign does not have any central message. No one can say why one should be voting Hillary.

A vote for Trump is a vote for another  World War
