I spray the faucets, counter, sink, dish pan, and fridge/microwave/stove/toaster oven handles/panels with vinegar water once a day.   Call me OCD,  but it only takes 5 minutes.  There are worse addictions.

Growing up in the favelas in Brazil, i don't ever remember how many times I ate food dropped on the floor or how many apples I ate before washing, like my mom used to lovely advised us. 30 years later, I don't remember the last time I had a fever related to bacterial infection! Ah! Lysol or Purcell in Brazil????? Lol! Really!

The floor is perpetually nasty from cat feet that have been in the litter box and human shoes that have been outside, on a farm, with goats. I used to eat off the floor until I started hanging out with so many sources of fecal bacteria.

That is disgusting.

I do not touch anything from the floor or carpet without washing or rinsing my hand or fingers.

How on earth shall I put food from the floor into my mouth?

I do that only on my meal mat/ rug and only if the rug has been swept shortly before.

Who doesn't clean faucets regularly? They get all gunked up.

It's because the floor makes my food dusty, not because of bacteria (at least for me).

As my mother used to say: you've got to eat a peck of dirt before you die.

It helps to make our immune system better.

That's dumb. The floor is nasty, sweeping it doesn't get rid of bacteria.

Good way to disinfect the kitchen sponge is putting it in the microwave for two minutes.

You stay classy NYT, never consulting with this doctor is the truly healthy choice.

Nikk La Sass who does this remind you of??  LMAO!!!!! Tag Jennifer in this!

I've heard that from the first 2 seconds to 4 seconds, the bacteria wont have on food, is it right? :D

Other surfaces are more dangerous for example the podiums used by politicians in debates....yuck

Alex Kendall  cleaning party today after work?? lol

The first thing I do when I get off the plane is buy a can of Lysol. If only you knew how "well" they clean hotels.

Who doesn't clean the handles on the fridge?! Gross.

Hiyori our actions validated

Did doctors for Trump support this message?

Or the kitchen sink

You're a doctor.  You're also gross.  Don't eat food off the floor. Ick.  But I do try to avoid touching public bathroom faucets and door handles.

Full disclosure I use an arbitrary span of time: 30 seconds rule.

And the cellphone too that's forever in my hand..

Me to most of the times tastes better too

Avoid eggs.

I think about it all. Haha #allgermsmustdie

Or the handle on the gas pump.

We all picked up food that we drop on the floor
