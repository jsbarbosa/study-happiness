"You're right about islamophobia, it's a shame." 10 seconds later he basically says that muslins were responsible for what happened in Orlando and Paris." Seriously american people, how could you let this man go so far !?

This debate is history and we are fortunate enough to be witnessing it - it is the lowest point to which American politics has ever sunk to.

I'm an Aussie watching from afar. This might be the worst debate performance I've ever seen by anyone in politics. The first 15 minutes were so bad that calling it a train wreck doesn't do it justice... How did this man get to this point? 😳

Donald Trump - Please read and study the United States Constitution.

He's a racist womanizing idiot, he doesn't answer any questions he just keeps trying to attack her. Hillary Clinton will be the next president of the United States.!

The question is no longer who is going to win this election, but rather how much she is going to win by. And judging from this debate - A LOT!

Congratulations Hilary Clinton you will be a great first woman President of the United States of America, which is historic and encouraging to all young women!

Donald J. Trump is out of his mind. Really. Most of what he says doesn't make any sense, and what does make sense is against our constitution. Trump has imploded.

He's so awful. How can anyone even remotely consider voting for him?

LOL.. WAAWAAAA..she went over her two minutes i want extra minutes.....maybe if you answer the question other then keep saying stupid comments and use your two minutes to answer....ayeee

He's not doing anything to lay out a vision! He just attacks Hillary and bully the moderators! His darkness is truly shining through tonight!

The Puritans left England to come here for religious freedom. Our Constitution, the foundation of our democracy, states that there should be Separation of Church and State so as to ensure religious freedom to people of ALL religions (not just Christianity).

When can you call someone a "racist"? 
When they have a swastika tattoo? When they are wearing a "Support the KKK" t-shirt? When they are waving a confederate flag and carrying a "White Power" sign? When they deny equality of the races? When they won't admit equality of the races? When they spout Hate-speech? When they try to divide Americans rather than bring us together? When they support Trump ... and their only justification they will admit to is repeating lies about Hillary for which they have no proof?
I would call any of the above "Deplorable"!

Amazes me how far his endless stream of rhetoric has brought him. The ad hominem, false equivalences, and a multitude of other logical fallacies are being spewed with little to no relevance to the topic at hand.

Stance on health care? Let's get rid of it, but I don't really have a plan after getting rid of Obama Care. Independent companies are trustworthy enough to regulate themselves.

Stance on Muslims? Islamophobia is a terrible thing, but let me just proceed to list a few times where they did indeed terrorize our country. Oh, and let's determine a person's eligibility to enter this country by their religion. Even though religion has no correlation with natural born, physical traits that are necessary to distinguish and discriminate.

Hillary definitely isn't an angel, but this election is a matter of whom we can tolerate more, honestly.

Hang in there Hillary. Keep the same temperment. 30 more minutes and TRUMP in done.

And Craig that is. Because Trumpster was a gangster thug on the attack all night with a face pretty unhappy because his campaign is imploding! The big pig! Call him for what he is!

Thulane Cult Hillary Clinton did not create the many years of oppression of your people before her so don't be laying blamw at her door.

Melania Trump is wandering around by herself she's not shaking hands with anyone is not engaging anyone what kind of first lady is she going to be?

He was absent the day they taught American government in school.

Here is one thing that I have to say. My 90 year old father in law has always said one thing about honesty and liars. You can only trust Drunks and Children in the terms of lying.  Well Hillary doesn't seem to be drunk and she is certainly not a child. The same can be said for Trump. Please do not forget that that I am not for either candidate, but Hillary is so bad. Please do not forget that Obamacare is thw child of the healthcare system she pushed as the 1st Lady.

(Mark Erwin)Trump didn't say there would be a ban based on religion. She reapted the say what you see that Trump said prior to his time on the floor. Hillary is struggling!!!! I am for neither but Trump is superior.

She was right in what she said, but he answered in front of the lady who asked the question, in a rude and accusing manner.

A lot of people are wondering how someone like Trump made it this far in the race. It's money, folks. This is what it looks like to buy your spot on the ballot. It's frustrating to think there are much better suited candidates for president but who don't have the budget to run a campaign the size of Trumps and Hillarys.

i m not American & i m trying to be concerned about world politics,  that's why i watched this debate..  rather than a debate, it was more like an entertainment show!!

You can not to even say that shows how much we have went of the farm .Anything goes now as to all that has happen .I am finding little truth in this or even a viable plan for the future

again, hes going to ban muslims UNTIL we have a way to tell which person is dangerous and which isn't. You people need to get ALL the facts. Same with other types of immigrants.

This man is the dumbest man on the planet all he has is word jam

I say again, Trump is mentally unbalanced!  His family looks like they are at a funeral, to live with this crazy man has got to be a strain.

He wants to BAN murderers and criminals. Hillary wants to let them all in- and put them on welfare. Guess who wins the point?

He had no idea how insulting his answer was to the woman who asked the question.

Islamophobia, lol. Muslims have a phobia about everybody who is not believing in the ridiculous and evil fairytale called Islam. So let´s talk about that!

So if I am asked my religion when I return from overseas travels, I think I will say I am Muslim. Think he'll try to keep out a white female?

Just sitting here laughing at this man...answer the freaking question..this is a joke....

i don't pretend not to have said stupid ridiculous things many many times, i never robbed 13 billion dollars from most desperate people of an entire nation like Haiti, over 300 dead this week left living in squalor in tents 7 years later...never been responsible for the deaths and murders of millions of people well over 500,000 children alone .... have not planned on further enslaving the American people, decision is an easy one for me....TRUMP!

All Trump can do is either sniff or say it's a disaster, or wait, interrupt the moderators.

He promised to prosecute her. That is awesomely huge. Finally. Someone wants to give us some justice against this evil and corrupt cartel. I'm Voting For Jill Stein on November 8, 2016 A women we can trust. She has not been treasonous.

This man-child-pathetic-beast is sickening. His strategy is to lie like crazy and talk over Hillary at every point. I am sure his brain dead zombie followers are lapping it up, but please America wake up and find your values and integrity. Do you want to show your children this is leadership, this is a possibility for the highest office in the United States?

Being from Florida I propose banning anyone from the NE to ruling over my region. Keep your diseased politicians away from the south. What the hell is wrong with your state?

So because a black person asked the question he immediately answers that with the inner cities are terrible isn't that a grand assumption that black people live in inner cities in terrible places?

He wiped the floor with her. She has absolutely NOTHING to contribute, to a town hall, to a debate, to all of society. Pathetic individual.

All mighty Trump in all of his wisdom is going to decide who enters the U.S. based on religion. He just got religion last month didn't he?

he doesnt know the first thing about syria so he just keeps repeating its bad its bad

This guy his no idea about world policy what in the hell is he talking about.

Hillary Clinton mentioned powers (presidential power related to the veto), but she also alluded to Giuliani (a 911 love-in)...and Clinton mentioned some harmed by rushing towards 'danger' (something about women, too, as maybe a bit uncomfortable)...Austen-Danger-Powers as springs-to-mind...Giuliani undermined line-item veto, though - something Clinton leaves-out....

Whereas the off-putting aspects of Powers reminds one of Trump...he proved more durable....

Trump saying Clinton doesn't know who the rebels are (not a comment on the specifics of that claim, but....)  Trump as Darth Vader to Clinton as Leia...: you-are-PART-of-the-REBEL-alliance...and-are-a-traitor...TAKE-her-away!!

(Though the Scottish accent of Prowse was dubbed-over by James Earl Jones...with Cooper and CNN...to dub-over Trump's Scottish bluster with James Earl Jones...like a CNN audio-hologram...like Michael Jackson posthumous moonwalking?)

Hillary Clinton would try to CLAIM that they're not at-war with Islam, but, rather...it seems that they ARE at-war with Islam, but, that they don't want to be TAGGED for that, and would instead try to 'Bantustan' Islam into an antidisestablishmentarian mode conducive to the Neocon driven war.

The animus of that war against Islam seems to be a race-war -- hence, why racial-profiling surfaced with that war being heightened.

NOW Clinton and Trump would try to wedge Muslims and have some inform on others, having them racially-profile each other, furthering such racial-profiling for the apartheid Neocon aims.

(Trump doesn't seem to realize that 'Honest Abe' was a sarcastic sobriquet - Lincoln as MUCH like Clinton in terms of mendacity - Trump's statements are hardly mendacious as transparent hyperbole (in-general-terms) though THAT statement as didn't seem hyperbole as meant but that Trump BELIEVES that.)

Talk about defeating ISIS sounds like pledges as to invading Iraq (they'd-defeat-ISIS they'd claim...they'll-be-greeted-as-liberators they claimed) - ISIS seems like a predictable counterweight to the Neocons.

Hillary Clinton wants to heel-our-country...

(like a dog?)

Trump: 'this is like medieval-times'

Garafolo: no cutlery IN medieval times...not cutlery AT Medieval-Times

There-is-no-spoon?! ('The Matrix')

Kiss-without-consent equated with a form of rape? (maybe regulatory-capture overreach, in that, trying to drum-up-business (?))

Cooper's gay-blinders...as SO allergic to the THOUGHT of a woman being kissed?

William Shatner 'SNL' (to Cooper) have-you-ever-kissed-a-girl?!

(Copyleft Shaul Ben-Yimini October 9,s 2016)

Hillary Clinton...and Donald Trump...in a university setting...where she hopes to be able to say to him that I (she) will-Trump-U?!

Why is Alec Baldwin sparring with a Ghostbuster?

Is that ECTOplasm on her -- as she's an ectomorph Ghostbuster (than the Gilmore-Girl Ghostbuster as more an endomorph - with endoplasm on her?)

Recent new-old comments by Trump (Tel Aviv and Altneuland...oxymoronic...like a public and private position) seem a sideshow distraction, and here might be a gedanken experiment proof of as-much:

Can one imagine someone as sitting on the fence as to whether to support Trump or Clinton, hearing Trump's tape, and then concluding from THAT to support Trump?!

Well...no...not likely....

So why is it otherwise that one might think someone might be on the fence, hearing that, and from THAT deciding how to vote?!

RATHER...it seems the case that those against Trump are still against him, and those for him are still for him - it's irrelevant, in other words....

Meanwhile...one might think that McCain's disavowal proceeds from that McCain's just jealous?

McCain can't grab anything, like Bob Dole, whose arm is busted, he must just say easy-boy while watching Pepsi-Spears, instead.

For all the hits that Trump is taking...it's not like that Bob Dole fought and lost an arm to then watch Tammy Duckworth videos...though Hillary Clinton's special friend from the DNC felt more telethon recalling than 'Born On The Fourth Of July,' or with Christopher Reeve...there-is-no-spoon (Keanu Reeves) as might lift that sad-sack (Sad Keanu meme) into eating her cookie ('The Matrix' - stand-BACK...while-I-eat-a-potato-chip!! - 'The Other Side of the Mountain' (movie-of-the-week)) and feeling right-as-rain ('The Matrix' - 'Matrix' as an earlier Carrie-Anne Moss item - she from Canada, like Celine, as Hillary's former theme-maker...they ARE going to debate in Las Vegas...hmm...maybe more Jerry-Lewis-telethon-esque Hillary-munchkin-cameos...(than with Dorothy))...Mario Cuomo as talking about FDR leaving his wheelchair to lift the country from its knees....

"With prior Republican nominees for president, I disagreed with them on politics, policies, principles, but I never questioned their fitness to serve. Donald J. Trump is different." – Hillary Clinton

can you image trying to make a point with that gross pig bully standing there swaying, sniffling and threatening to speak ...?

He's a Question Dodger  of the First order! All fluff no substance.

don't be complacent. Yes- we think he is a racist stupid womanizer. But his followers love him!

He just suggested the use of nuclear weapons, has any idea of what he is getting into?

You cannot lump everyone from one religion into the same category!

If they played soundbytes with chants of 'Jerry!...Jerry!...Jerry!'....you would forget this is even a battle for POTUS

Pretty funny that the moderators have to correct Trump.

What's your strategy? My strategy is that I can't tell you cuz then everyone will know. This is not a plan!!!

Wow. Asking Hillary if Trump is a good candidate for President? What kind of question is that? Really? Really?

I'm all for gun control but in Donald Trump's case I'll make an exception!!!!

Hillary Clinton sinsi bi kişilik. İçten içe aşırı nefret ve kin barındırıyor çok tehlikeli bi kadın olabilir. Trump direkt kötü, besbelli.
Sinsileri hiç sevmem.Trump yüzsüz,utanmaz,gaddar olabilir fakat inkar etmiyor.Kahinat güzeline bile laf koydu.Özür dilemedi,haklısınız dedi.
ha bu yaptığı doğru mu, tabii ki yanlış. İkiside bok gibi

Just answer the questions Donald!!!

In 1980 Jimmy Carter signed an executive order ordering Iran students in the US to leave. Jimmy Carter is a liberal democrat. I am glad president Carter made that order.

"We are a country founded on religious freedom and liberty."
This will make me laugh years from now. :D

This freak show is depressing.

Wow when the commentator knows more about the military than you, you might be loosing the presidential race

Are americans that stupid to believe Donald Trump?.. it remains to be seen..

....separation of church and state....country founded on freedom of religion....hmmmm?

Moderators don't really control things....too bad...

Muslims must pinky promise to throw each other under the bus....

I keep trying to imagine Christine Lagarde's reaction to a TrumpTanty. :D

Trump will say it's just words - you know he means nothing!!🤑🤑

Lying again. Did you people make stuff up without actually watching the debate

Neither is fit to be president. Hillary supporters can't ignore the corruption and pass it off as lies. Trump supporters already know he doesn't have the temperament to be a president. Remember, these are not your only choices as president. Are you going to vote for someone or against someone? Don't you think America deserved better than these 2? Even if Johnson doesn't win, voting for him could stop both of these poor choices from getting into the White House.

As an American I am extremely humiliated by this debate, a horrification to our presidency.

This was nice to see.
I hope everyone had a takeaway!!

One thing is clear for me. American and Mexican politicians are the same trash!

Guys, just out of curiosity does he has breathing problem and can someone please get him inhaler before next debate:)

Trump ganó ampliamente el debate. Hizo tragar en seco a la Señora Clinton

Hillary addressed the Muslim lady with the question while cheetos was only addressing God knows what

well if religion becomes the reason we can't have other basic freedom like going to the mall.... than yeah he should do that

I see he is having the sniffing mic issue again

Hillary has nerves of steel

Obama has already banned people. How many of the Syrian and Eqyptian Catholic refugees has been admitted to the US in refugee status. Wait for it!!!! ZERO. We know they're not Islamic terrorists!

I love watching the collapse of our Republic live on tv.

'He grabbed me:' Woman alleges Trump groped her exactly as described on tape

Jill Harth, a pageant owner trying to work with Trump in the mid-1990s, filed suit against him in federal court in Manhattan in 1997, describing a “relentless” campaign of sexual harassment and assault including an incident in which he reached under a table, put his hands on her thighs and grabbed her “intimate private parts” during a meeting at a New York restaurant.

TRUMPED UP HOGWASH!!! THE SOCIETY THAT MADE 5O SHADES OF GREY, TWERKING, AND RAP MUSIC A HUGE SUCCESS, IS NOW OUTRAGED OVER A FEW BAD WORDS, BY MR. TRUMP. "IF YOU LISTEN TO RAP MUSIC, GAME OF THRONES, GIRLS, 'ORANGE IS THE NEW BLACK', LIKE LAURA DUNHAM, OR THINK BILL CLINTON IS AWESOME, YOU ARE A HYPOCRITE!!"  GIMME A BREAK!! HOW HYPOCRITICAL.

MR. TRUMP WAS NOT PREVIOUSLY A POLITICIAN, CONSEQUENTLY, MUCH OF HIS SPEECH WAS PREVIOUSLY UNGUARDED, AND NOT SCRIPTED, AS OTHER POLITICIANS WE ENCOUNTER. I AM SURE WOMEN HAVE HAD MANY VERY INTERESTING PRIVATE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT MEN THAT HAVE NOT BEEN RECORDED!!!  THIS CONVERSATION IS NOTHING BUT HYPE AND JOKING AROUND. WHY DOES NOT HRC HAVE SUCH OUTRAGE ABOUT HER HUSBANDS PAST ACTIONS IN THE WH. OUR CHOICE IS TO CHOOSE KNOWN CORRUPTION, VS. A MAN WHO MADE A FEW BAD CHOICES OF WORD SELECTION.

As a result, with all of the corruption and lies from this administration and HRC, I could care less about some conversation that has nothing to do with saving this country from the liberal Communist/ Socialist agenda. THESE STATEMENTS WERE NOT MEANT TO BE TAKEN LITERALLY!!

This was just locker room banter, guys do this all the time. This kind of talk is not meant to be public, Just "locker talk"and private conversations. What happened to our Constitutional rights of free speech when talking privately and not violating other people's rights?? Although  this conversation was HYPE, no one was harmed. No feelings would have been hurt if no one had secretly recorded and released this conversation. We should all have the expectations of a certain amount of privacy. We are slowly turning into a Socialist/Communistic country where the government and media are involved in every little nook and cranny of our lives.   MOREOVER, THIS OCCURRED WHEN HE WAS A PRIVATE CITIZEN 11 YEARS AGO AS A BUSINESSMAN WHILE JOKING IN WHAT HE THOUGHT WAS A PRIVATE ENVIRONMENT.  SO SAD AND DANGEROUS!!

WE CANNOT BE DISTRACTED FROM THE REAL ISSUES AND CORRUPTION AFFECTING THIS COUNTRY FROM ALL OF HRC'S CURRENT AND PAST SCANDALS!! WHAT MATTERS MORE,  MR. TRUMP'S DECADES OLD LOCKER TALK, OR CLINTON'S MODERN DAY WISH TO DESTROY THE NATION.

LETS NOT BE DISTRACTED, DEMAND WE TALK ABOUT THE REAL ISSUES. THE DEMS WANT TO DISTRACT THE POPULATION AWAY FROM THEIR HIDDEN AGENDAS HIGHLIGHTED IN WIKILEAKS EMAILS. MAINLY OPEN BORDERS AND A GOLOBALISTIC ECONOMY BASED ON SAUL ALINSKY RULES (COMMUNISM/SOCIALISM). STAY VIGILANT FOR THE STABILITY OF OUR COUNTRY PLEASE.

Mr. Trump, I'll remind you of the question....

I'm embarrassed for my country....

Madam President!

Hillary clinton say's america is founded  on religious freedom & liberty?????????............ Check the history of black people who where killed in the name of religion, burn inside the church in the name of religion, hanged in the name of religion, inside the church black people wouldn't sit amongst white people,they were on the other hall or shoved outside in the name of religion, in the name of religion white people found out that it made their lives pleasant than of a black people and it made sure it liberated even a young white boy to call n 85 year old black man "a boy" taught by his white parents............................ Hillary clinton needs to check again her statement before assassination the character of Donald trump........... #voteDonldTrump

Trump is sniffing again.

But he doesn't KNOW that, Hillary.

I think Donald duck speaks very clear than donald trump.

hillary clinton. words are words and rape is rape

Donald: what's Aleppo? Where's Libya?

#trumpisacunt

Sniff

Trump it's you should be in jail 😂😂😂

Trump is so empty. This is so sad.

She is loosing

May God Bless you madam Hillary Clinton.

PRESIDENT HILLARY CLINTON 2016!!!!!

children in America are waking up in shelter

Please!  Anything out of this mans mouth is ridiculous.  She has been the ruler and Queen for 30 years?  Blame her for everything.  Hate to say it, but he should be tested for drugs.  He behaves like he has a cocaine addiction.  Sniff some more Donald.  Love the anger, don't you?

Can you imagine being the parent of a child that you had to send overseas to fight for this country based on an Executive Decision made by one of these two?  Thank God I don't have kids.

I can't believe people are saying Chump did well.  He didn't answer any questions that was asked of him.  All he did was point out the things Hillary, Obama, and Bill may or may not have done, and repeat how Hillary never did anything for 30 years.

The way Clinton answers question about Aleppo shows that she  is very familiar with the region and its problems and what is at stake. Trump does not even know where Aleppo is.  Just listen to him. He just avoids the question.

Can we ban idiots and start with Trump?

I think someone forgot about the cold war....

Trump and Pence are on totally different pages.

Tom for president Trump did not win. He never answered the questions asked of him.  Dream on. Your candidate is nothing but a pathetic cokehead!

Potential immigrants aren't guaranteed ANYTHING.  They are not citizens, and they can be excluded from being able to immigrate, if they are thought to pose a threat.  It doesn't matter WHAT their religion is.  If they pose a threat, they can be excluded from immigration.

He is an absolute disaster.

Gwen should take care of our own people.

You guys said it all – how Drumpf attacked religion, woman, race and he even attacked the military.  But when he mocked Hillary in that ugly tone (as if he belittle a woman): "she says, she wants to be tough"; well she has 30 years of foreign knowledge, as well as at home and had negotiated with world tough leaders.

What has he done?

Trump is making a fool out of USA.

Yeah DJT how are you going to ban people based on a religion ????

The debate transcript demonstrates that Trump just could not focus on the questions.  Tangents, non sequiturs, and finally, outright threats to jail his political opponent(s).  Reminded me of Nixon, Haldemann, and Erlichmann.

GO TRUMP

Dump the Trash Trump

Donand Dump should just be put to sleep!

Donald Trump totally won the debate!  His Lincoln remarks and the jail remark were classic!  Huge win!  He was fighting three against one and kicked Hillary's butt!  Martha actually argued with him!!!!  Martha was not supposed to be debating Trump, Hillary was.  TRUMP HIT IT OUT OF THE PARK!

Trump statement: #howstupidisourcountry

TRUMP FOR PRESIDENT

Trump won this one.

Just like Jimmy Carter did

Clinton's answers were sane and mature. Trump was sniveling, snorting and rude.

Trump is a cokehead! Sniff!

#letgarydebate

He's a bad man and people don't care what he says!

Martha thank you

Watch Jill Stein on fb!

Can anyone post a non-Facebook link to this clip? I want to use it in classroom discussion. Thanks!





again he has NEVER answered a question he was asked...sad person

he would be an absolute nightmare for the envrionment

she wins

Rwally? Really? Really? Really? Anderson Cooper shame on you!!!!!

He said radical islam...not muslims...

Were we politically correct against the Nazis?

https://www.thevenusproject.com/the-venus-project/

'Illegal Immigrant' is not a religion.  OK.  What about Syrian refugees?  Do we let everyone carry a pressure cooker to parades?   And then try to figure out which one has a bomb.  TOO risky  right now.  AND they don't want to come here!

Bullcrap

PRESIDENT HILLARY CLINTON 2016!

Clinton = House of Cards

It is called extreme vetting.   And if the so called impartial moderator would not have rudely interrupted him he could have explained it.

Let's write in Powell/Rice or Stewart/Colbert for President

New York times = JOKE

Go packers!

Cool

Hillary lied about that.  He wants to stop immigration from countries considered terrorist hot spots until proper vetting procedures are implemented a la Israel.

Did Trump just say Russia is "new" in terms of nuclear?

where is the Haitian refugees ?

Good God...you, donnie, and your lil itty hands, are disgusting. you are the anti-christ.  snorty snorty snorty

He never said ban Them , he said we need to vet  to make sure they will not harm Americans

How's it gonna do that?  Go door to door?

Hillary is awesome!  She is rockin it!!!!

Waterboard the muslims and build a wall for the mexicans.  Ban the asians period.

Body language of Granny HRC?  Does it differ from what could be derived from her vocalisations?

Hillary is just not electable.  Who is she lecturing too?
