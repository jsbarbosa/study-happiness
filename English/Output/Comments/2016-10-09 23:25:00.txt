Just pay attentions to the way he intends to use the law and how he threatens to retaliate against those who speak against him, and you will see how dangerous this man is. After all, he admires Putin!

FACTCHECK: Does NYT want Clinton as President?
A: True...
The problem is when "unbiased" journalism gets 'in bed' with politicians...the NYT's endorsement of Clilnton leaves no doubt as to the spin of their reporting...

You missed Trump pointing the finger and never giving specifics on his plans. Because he speaks in fluffy words and has no plans. That's all. Enjoy the rest of your evening.

This debate was horrific ... and a stark reminder of what political discourse has degenerated to. Watching this tonight was a colossal face-palm. Honestly, if this is where POTUS debates are headed, let's never have another one - ever again.

She is the pure evil..you can see it in her eyes..she can hear the screaming of Iraqi and Libyan people fight for the life..!! She is not the person media showing us..most of people thinks trump is evil because of some of his statements..but they can't see what this woman done to the world by her decisions..cause conspiracy theories hidden it under full of lies..!!

Wow the NYT is ridiculous. How arrogant are you? To lie about true/false then mince words in the 'more' section.. you think Americans are as stupid as Clinton does. Smh.. you're a sad sad group

So let me get their straight... Hillary defended a child rapist, had people killed in Benghazi, deleted 33k emails on a private server, systematically created and armed ISIS, had 6 billion dollars unaccounted for as Secretary of State. And the media doesn't care. Donald Trump said something 11 years ago in a "locker room conversation" and the media is now going crazy. The hypocrisy is astounding!
#AmericaStandsWithTrump #TrumpPence2016

In your "Fact Checking" on the deleted emails you need to clarify that she gave instructions for them to be deleted in December 2014, long before any subpoena. The contractor mistakenly failed to do so. After the subpoena was issued,  the contractor went ahead and of their own volition, deleted the emails they were supposed to have deleted in December 2014, before fulfilling the subpoena. This has been investigated by the FBI and Clinton cleared. You should also clarify that "BleachBit" is freeware and not "extremely expensive", as Trump would have people believe. It's a registry cleaner.  Very commonly used.

And Canadian healthcare is NOT a disaster.  No, we do NOT come down there for operations. Where does he get this crap? If we are sick here, we are cared for by the doctors of our choice expediently. If you wait, it's to make sure someone in dire need gets what they need. I've lived in both countries, I know how it feels to decide whether to buy food of see a doctor in the USA, but here? Healthcare is a basic human right. I hope you all get that security

He killed American jobs. Hired illegal immigrants. His products are made out of the country. Used China steel instead of steel from this country. He has betrayed this country and its workers. Not to mention the workers he has stiffed.

My favorite was when she would tell the American public to go to HER website to fact check her. 😂😂😂 That's like saying, I'm not lying! If you don't believe me, just ask me!

A debate between a politician (none of them are saints) and a narcisistic, wannabedictator, disrespectful, facist, crazy, dangerous psycopath, who should you vote for? 🤔

I don't know how one takes the high road against Trump. Hillary did a pretty good job of it, but not perfect. But if she had let him dump all over her, she would have been perceived as weak and if she hadn't defended herself on a few occasions, then his accusations would have been perceived as true. It's just too bad there couldn't be a "no insult" debate format. Cut off the other's mike while one candidate is speaking. It really isn't fair to the American public.

Let's take a poll
How many guys being trump supporters here have actually spoken about women in the manner trump has?  For those supporters of trump who have no problem with it you shouldn't have a problem admitting it and standing side by side with him in your support.  
Now for me NEVER and I'm not a trump supporter as I actually have common sense and in all of my years of being in the locker room or with anyone in my life and that's hundreds of thousands of guys I've never heard it ever in person.  Trump says we all do it and it's acceptable but I'm trying to find out who "all" is.

Can Trump or any of his lackeys for once #answerthequestion without deflecting to Hillary? We're asking about you! I'd accept this some time, but they NEVER answer. It's a shell game folks, believe me.  #neverTrump p.s. That was the worst "debate" I've ever witnessed.  Where are there 12 people in that townhall forum? They went to the audience a total of four times. There was absolutely no substance.

Dictator Trump. He snorted and stomped around like a bull in a ring and hovered uncomfortably close to Hillary at times while wagging his short finger in her direction. Clearly he is a bully and thug, not just in words but in physical/psychological terms too.

Facts checkers... neither one of them is fit... this time around both candidates are a joke.... but I'm sticking with her only because she is a better choice than that disgusting pig!!!!

Donald needs to learn about manners, when someone is talking he is not supposed to interrupt😡. He really was a bully, LIES, no foreign policy knowledge, did not bring to debate ANY PLANS for America. If he would only behave maybe the American people who are still undecided can finally choose a candidate. But my vote will always be for Hillary Clinton.

Oh NYT. Half of America DESPISES your publication and the way you have covered this years election. Biased. I wish someone would fact check you. Donald J. Trump won this debate. Now go help your lying, crooked, career politician. What would she do with out you?

Now is the time for the women Trump, as he said on the tape, made a move on, kissed without their consent and grabbed by the p---y to come forward and file charges because he was lying tonight, as anyone could clearly see, when he said that he had never actually done any of the things he is heard bragging that he did on the tape. How would he like it if Hillary Clinton rounded them all up in time for the next debate and paraded them in front of Melania to mimic the pathetic, dirtbag stunt he pulled at tonight's debate?

NAFTA didn't cause the loss of jobs? Employment in America has been growing for ten years? 

Yeah. "Do you want fries with that" employment has been growing. 

And 10 million more Americans have jobs than when Obama took office?

Round that number down.
It isn't that ten million more ppl have jobs, it's that 3.3 million ppl have 3 jobs just so they can pay rent and eat.

Biased are we? 6 answers from Trump for every 1 answer from Clinton and every Trump answer has a negative response. Most of the Clinton answers had a positive response. I don't support either of them, but it's obvious that the author of this article is a Hillary supporter.

Deborah Anderson they weren't supposed to be on an unsecured private server in the first place, she wasn't supposed to just delete them. Government servers archive the old documents, and that is what was supposed to be done.

I know, it's a confusing situation... Why does it matter what server highly classified documents are on? Well, some of those documents may have sensitive information which, if acquired by hostile entities, could endanger our national security. I know her position also has a confusing name... Wasn't she just a secretary? Well no, actually the position was quite a high level position, it's not like a clerical secretary. So yea, Clinton engaged in criminal activity, she lied about it, and while the director of the FBI stated that someone else would likely get some form of censure and have their security clearance considerably restricted, they had no evidence of intent to commit the crime she had committed. Though, I'm not sure how they couldn't, given the fact she lied about it. So, no she wasn't cleared. The director of the FBI acknowledged that she had engaged in criminal activity by using the unsecured private servers (yes there were plural), and he acknowledged that she lied. 

I think perhaps, instead of relying on the media for information of this sort, you might consider going to the source. In this case it would be the FBI. They have a website, and a page dedicated to the investigation of the crime being discussed at this point, on that page they have the full statement given to the press. By reading it directly from them, you won't be confused about the facts, it's very in depth and thorough.

Maybe the "fact checkers" should check up on the word fact, here I can even help them. Fact : something that truly exists or happens : something that has actual existence : a true piece of information. Now just apply this liberally ( pun intended ) and literally to all candidates equally.

You can fact check the hell out of his crazy words, but it's a waste of time. His worshippers don't care about fact. They simply want some who is racist, xenophobic and sexually abusive in power. Someone who makes it okay to hate. Trump fits the profile, perfectly.

The NYT biased posts almost make me want to vote for Trump because I am so sick of "unbiased journalism" being nothing but BIASED journalism from you! It makes me think that I can't get a REAL answer from anyone! It makes me feel like you have a deal with her and are untrustworthy...the both of you!

Fact checks but no links to related articles talking about some of the statements being made by these two ..... something I found about nafta the other day ...... http://www.learnliberty.org/blog/explainer-what-you-should-know-about-nafta/ ....

I believe in free trade but it must be done in a fair and gradual way so that it doesn't throw an industry into chaos. So if Hillary continues to deny that the short-sightedness of the NAFTA planners has caused any damage you can write off PA, MI, and OH

You can fact check all you want but take a drive. No matter where we live we can find thousands of boarded up businesses, rotting factories and endless yard sales. That is reality. Just look around. NAFTA killed us. Hillary just wants to tap dance on the grave we are already buried in.

Did you check the facts using your liberal bias glasses or did you employ actual ethical journalism? I ask, because historically, you've worn your glasses.

Next debate please bring some of the Trump groped accusers and put them in the front row.  What is good for the goose is good for the gander.  Trump has plenty of women he has groped out there due to  his power and influence.......even Ivanka in a sworn deposition (that she later recanted under settlement for money) claimed that Trump forcibly raped her.  This man is scum....and I just do not understand how so many Americans can even consider a Trump presidency as good for this nation.

He's either delusional or an habitual liar, neither of which make him an ideal president. And people call Clinton loose with the truth. Gimme a break!

I had hoped that Hillary might start the debate by handing Trump a box of Orange Tic Tacs so that he would know from the outset that he’s not fooling anyone. I didn’t get my wish, but NYT Readers can make it come true.
Please mail 1 box of Orange Tic Tacs to:
Donald J. Trump

725 5th Ave, 
New York, NY 10022

Justin Robert I agree with you ! Several times Trump was pointing ! So rude and can't even tell you his plans .Trump just says it's going to be great .it wonderful folks !

Oh good the media and their "fact checkers" have arrived. What could go wrong, no possible way they could be bias or have an agenda. 😂😂 Honestly though, we're screwed with those two.

He reminds me of Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev at the end of his reign when he was simply unable to understand the reality. His family confirmed many times that Brezhnev wanted to retire but the political leadership of the Soviet Union did not allow him to go as they were able to do whatever they wanted. There are many advantages when the political leader is unable to understand the reality. His team decides, his team makes decisions, and his team can hide themselves and claim themselves victims of injustice and incompetence. I think now you understand those who aggressively defend him. They don't care about him. He is just a means to realize their true goals. To some extend Trump is a victim of all those who claim themselves his supporters. Later on he will be blamed and his supporters will come out of water dry.
When you grow on toxic environment of hatred and insult you cannot a a sweet fruit no matter hard you try to shine.
It is so funny to imagine him at the negotiations. The best thing he can do is be silent. When an uninformed person tries to express opinions it is at least funny and at most stupid. 
We admire former presidents and most of the time we don't care about their party affiliation. When you decide to vote think if you would like to repeat their ideas and accept them as role models. For me President is more than a person sitting in the White House. He is a symbol of intelligence the country has, fairness the protection of its policies, consistency of moral and democratic principles, generosity, forgiveness and support the country guarantees. And finally, I want not to be ashamed when my children repeat whatever the President of this great country says.
P.S. Dear Trump supporters, you might disagree with me but do not practice your insulting and vulgar vocabulary. I have no intention to fight with you.

She didn't have a good answer for any question all lies even blaming Abraham Lincoln for one of her lies she is truly unfit to run this country!!!

the thing about jobs and NAFTA: there may be more jobs but the majority of new jobs are either contract, casual, or part time with very little security and negative wages growth. PS Trump appropriated Sanders position in an effort to swing disillusioned Democrats, but it sounds so fake and disingenuous coming from Trump who obviously exploits the system.

Could this possibly be swayed in one direction any worse??!! Times is historically a democratic paper......but your first obligation is to REMAIN neutral, stick to the facts, and report to by our readers.....in case you weren't sure, THAT'S who buys your papers, NOT Hillary!!

We did NOT lose jobs over NAFTA ???? what ! it is a fact the companies started leaving because of NAFTA....WOW....I hope people fact check your facts....Hillary even acknowledged this resulted in companies moving out of this country at her rally and DNC.

Why is there no discussion about all of donald's name-brand products being produced at slave factories out of country or how he buys materials for his buildings out of country? What a hypocrite and liar he is.

Wow. Some fact check. "NAFTA didn't eliminate jobs!" No, it just eliminated high paying factory work, including our largest domestic industry. You can visit Detroit sometime if you'd like to see the effects in person.

I think these blatant lies should be flashed up on screen in 'real' time. Don't the voters have a right to know that they are listening to slanderous drivel??

the devil was sitting back on her chair and laughing then she spewed out lie and probably destroyed more Email and killed more people not answering the phone while her husband got another blow job from the woman who kept on cutting Trump off from answering thing

Both candidates have multiple flaws,  but I find your reporting awful,  you are so biased,  do you honesty think your readers are so stupid that they believe what you are saying? Why can't you report on both candidates and have more respect for your readers!

"The cache of emails includes campaign strategies aimed at keeping the public perception of Clinton favorable, focusing particularly on her transparency, especially in light of the FBI investigation into her use of a private email server. The strategies sometimes reveal the campaign presiding over stylistic points and emphasizing what is to be described as “on the record.”

Of particular note is one January 2015 document which includes references to Maggie Haberman. Formerly of Politico, Haberman now covers the presidential election for the New York Times. According to the leaked document, she’s a “friendly journalist” who has “never disappointed” in painting a positive picture of Clinton."

Defenders of Trump; You are an amazing and terrifying group of people, to the extent that I simply can't understand how your minds actually work. He's admitted to sexually assaulting women, and you pardon him. You say, "Yes, well, someone else did it too" or, "It was a long time ago" or, worse yet, that plenty of men speak this way about women so it's fine if he does as well. 

But explaining or normalizing this behavior is shameful. It demonstrates your readiness, willingness, and pride in promulgating the sexist structure of our society. You clearly fail to recognize or care that this leads to further disparagement of women, continued relegation of women to a second-class status, and worst of all, that it teaches young men and boys that sexual assault is, in certain instances, permissible. Widespread sexual assault on college campuses, high schools, and in the military all depend on this belief. Rather than viewing women and girls as fully equal human beings with their own agency, you continue to objectify them and define them in opposition to men, as their negation, and as their plaything. 

From the beginning, public concern about Trump has been less about the man, and more about the ugly face of regressive American society that has voted for him. We thought it had nearly been erased but for the lunatic fringe. But here it is, angry and proud, ready to follow Trump to the end. 

So defend Trump. If you have children, do it in front of them. Just make sure to show them the exact words you are defending so they can know, in full detail, what you are condoning. Teach your sons to emulate Trump. Teach your daughters that they should expect to be treated this way by men like him. Scar another generation if you so choose, but don't expect any respect from the rational rest of us.

Wow What an odd start to the day.  The NYT publishing something that is liberally biased.  What next, will the sun come out tomorrow or something?

A vote for hillary is a vote for islam and open borders. Take a look at paris and germany and sweden and london. A vote for hillary is a vote for the nwo whose goal is the destruction of america. Voting for killary is literally voting to destroy america.

The media becomes more desperate by the day, they were paid by the Democrats and the Clinton Foundation to deliver the Presidency to Hillary, which has become clear, is not going to happen not unless an even larger degree of voter fraud is committed than the one that elected Obozo. The media will try desperately to brainwash the Democrats while trying to encourage the Trump voters to stay home, which must never happen

If the Hillary haters want revenge for her emails, please go back and take care of the email private server users among their own -- check out W and Cheney for starters.

Didn't go thru them all, but i heard the tape of Hillary telling a Colleague, after she got the rapist off, she was laughing and said you couldn't trust a polygraph. She crucified that child on the stand to make her bones.

Honestly a "Fact Check" by the NYT??! So Trump was right on all counts. Good. You just have to reverse anything the NYT says and you've got a better idea as to what is really going on.

i don't pretend not to have said stupid ridiculous things many many times, i never robbed 13 billion dollars from most desperate people of an entire nation like Haiti, over 300 dead this week left living in squalor in tents 7 years later...never been responsible for the deaths and murders of millions of people well over 500,000 children alone .... have not planned on further enslaving the American people, decision is an easy one for me....TRUMP!

Your fact checks are bias and BS...the emails from Bengazhi went to whom they were required to...Cheryl Mills...with reference to SOS...read the emails....to say she is not guilty of sending help because she did not get the emails directly is bs....I am glad politifact posts REAL facts and not bias ones

With extraordinary courage and superior will, Mr Trump commanded a powerful attack against the smug, smirking Hillary, despite the media driven machine of destruction paid for by the devil."Woe unto the wicked Clinton and Obama monsters.

also fact check wrong on heathcare for children..this was Ted Kennedy's bill...written by Ted Kennedy ONLY...as First Lady Hillary helped to get it passed, along with Senator Hatch...that is it !

Hillary response on replacements on the supreme court,,she says..I want someone with world experience..I want some who will change the balance of the supreme court from what is has been.. Trump says I want someone like Anton Scalia, someone who believes in the untied states constitution! and will abide by the constitution and uphold it.

People want her emails you can find them beside the 2 mil that Bush deleted from a private server. What to blame Benghazi on her then go after your GOP for taking there security funding away and while you are crying for 4 people make sure to shed a tear for the 59 embassy people that died on Bushes watch. Trump needs to worry about Trump be cause his reckless talk about other races alone with the fact he is just plain stupid no plans, no strategy, facts are incorrect playing the blame game his disrespect for women was enough for him to do the right thing at the very end. Bow down to Hillary!!! Even he knows how strong and great she is!!!

NAFTA didn't kill American jobs, the Tbagger owners moved their factories to Mexico. I was working at MN Rubber Co. in St. Louis Park MN in 2000. It is part of the Quadion Corp. The machines were moved to its new factory in Mexico. The St. Louis plant was the most profitable plant in the company. The Mexico plant struggled to make good parts. It was bleeding money. Yet the St. Louis Park MN plant was the one closed. The owner was the son of the company founder. The St. Louise Park MN plant was the birth place of the company. It was torn down and the land sold and upscale condos now sit there. The owner is a rightwing Tbagger.

We are Trumps supporters, we need to stay united and have his back. There is nothing stronger than We The People. This corrupt government stands no chance against us, we must unite and not waver. We know the left and right are going to toss every lie they can to stop us. Let their crap go in one ear and out the other. Let's win this election and take back our country. If you need a reminder what we are fighting for, here it is.....

The Invasion of America

With the uncertainty we face today along with a Government so hostile to We The People, and with a President, who constantly usurps the Constitution, it is no wonder
we are heavily divided not only as a People but as Nation.

It is said this election is by far the most important, as the very existence of our Great Nation lay in the balance. America can no longer endure the destruction of her borders, language or culture. Americans are becoming second rate citizens, and are being tossed to the side and replaced with illegals that have no respect, knowledge or love for our country, our way of life or customs. 

America has been forced to bow to its enemies thanks to the power elites and the puppets in the Peoples House. America has lost its standing in the world as a super power and a friend to its allies. Our president has brought an invasion of illegals, hatred, crime and diseases, some not seen since biblical times to our shores. Many can not be cured and many will die.

If this continues, there will be no way to secure our nation, protect our people or our very way of life. America will erode into a third world country, not to mention We The people can no longer afford to support them all. At this rate, Americans will lose everything.... This is what you get when you have a want to be boy king in the White House with a magic phone and pen with his kumbaya politics and sham Presidency.

For to long, our politicians have become drunk on power to the point they believe they are kings and We The People no longer matter. To many that have created their own rules and laws with no regard for our Founders and their wisdom. All this because we, as a society have become lazy, we have become dependent on technology and instant gratification, we have become a nation of give me now, I can not wait. 

We have been indoctrinated instead of educated. We fell asleep, and now, we are paying the price. Our freedoms and our way of life are at stake. America is finally waking up, and it has found itself in a nightmare which could destroy our very foundation.  
Our government has no clue what it is doing; it can not control this social experiment it is attempting. It will get out of hand, and eventually over take them and us. 

America can not endure another four years of business as usual. Hillary and her progressive liberals will continue to push this social engineering ideology. If we do not stop her, it will grow like a cancer and destroy the very foundation; our nation’s principals were founded on. 

It is time for We The People to unite, it is time to stand strong and rid ourselves of this corrupt government that looks to not only destroy our history but to rewrite it and create their own. Our history is the blood that flows through the arteries of our nation... Without it we would have no future... With the distortion and manipulation of our history taught today, we should never apologize for telling it the way it really happened.... 
The dedication and knowledge of our nation’s history, gives to those that would other wise, never know the truth.... “In memory of all who gave their lives to protect the freedoms of our Great Nation”.

To quote President Ronald Reagan; Freedom is never more than one generation away from extinction. we didn't pass it to our children in the bloodstream. It must be fought for, protected, and handed on for them to do the same, or one day we will spend our sunset years telling our children and our children's children what it was once like in the United States where men were free.

It is time for a real President; it is time for real leadership, it is time to Make America Safe Again. President Trump and Vice President Mike Pence, with We The People, will once again, Establish Justice, Insure Domestic Tranquility, Provide for the Common Defense, Promote the General Welfare, and Secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity… Donald J Trump and Mike Pence are our leaders that will fight to restore the government: OF THE PEOPLE, BY THE PEOPLE and FOR THE PEOPLE..

Yes, its time to stop this invasion, it is time to Make America Great Again …. This is a movement, and We The Peoples Voice are being heard loud and clear… God Bless President Donald J Trump, and Vice President Mike Pence, their families and all of us…. And God Bless The United States of America.. Please Share This. Thanks

People should have to write a presidential fitness test to obtain a license before being nominated for candidacy, with sections on:
▪ethics
▪economy
▪history
▪current affairs
▪the constitution
▪law
...just to eliminate people who lack the basic skills to serve as president.

best New Yorker Donald Trump "winning" the post office building bid from the feds. I am not cynical. Impress builder! Do not wait but build build build Mr.Builder. - THE FEDS MAGAZINE have you seen this?

You don't have to choose between Bill's principal enabler and Trump. Vote Gary Johnson. 

BTW before you mention Aleppo read below. 
Hillary,"we were under sniper fire"

Hillary,"we left the Whitehouse dead broke"

Hillary,"I was instrumental in the Irish peace process"

Hillary,"A hateful video caused Benghazi"

Hillary replied “I don’t know” a whopping 327 TIMES during her e-mail investigation. After SMASHING 13 iPads and iPhones!

Hillary," We all knew he was guilty as hell *laughs*" -when talking about a child molester she defended and won for 

Hillary, “floozy,” “bimbo” and “stalker,”effort to cast doubt on the Bill's accusers. 

Wolff: “And Brexit? Your position?” Trump: “Huh?” 
Wolff: “Brexit.” 
Trump: “Hmm.” 
Wolff: “The Brits leaving the EU.” 

Trump,"I remember watching the firefighters on 7/11"

Trump,"I will defend article 11 of the constitution!"

Trump,"I don't know why there are 13 stripes on the flag"

Trump thought Quds=Kurds

Trump,"I don't think my daughter Ivanka would pose for playboy, although she does have a very nice figure, I've said if Ivanka weren't my daughter perhaps I'd be dating her"

Trump about a married woman:"Yeah, that’s her. With the gold. I better use some Tic Tacs just in case I start kissing her. You know, I’m automatically attracted to beautiful — I just start kissing them. It’s like a magnet. Just kiss. I don’t even wait. And when you’re a star, they let you do it. You can do anything." 
"Grab ’em by the p***y. You can do anything."

All I'm going to say is that Hillary is married to the same kind of man Trump is, and she stands behind her husband  ..... so what's the difference?

The New York Times need to fact check their fact check. Bought and paid for by the liberals.

Trump debated Hillary and 2 moderators and still won.

Lol ... This rag needs to be fact check .... What a bunch of garbage !!! She lost the debate tonight .... Did Hillary delete 33,000 emails ?? Yes she did !!!

I like how it's equal and unbiased. I truly feel as though I can trust journalism again.

This is not fact checker..It shows, how NY times extremely help Hilary Clinton.How characterless people contest the USA elections.

Tweet of the Night: "I'm a Muslim, and I would like to report a crazy man threatening a woman on a stage in Missouri."

Like I would trust your "fact-checking" 😂

Clinton deleted her email but Trump didn't pay his taxes for 20 years.He is a rapist.

Poor USA , one of these 2 terrible candidates will the president of this great country

I see that the NYT checks only one side. What a disgrace.

Fact Check- Is the New York Times one of the Democratic Party's Super PAC- Absolutely true.

NYT endorses Clinton. How do you expect this to come out?

Where is the fact checking for Hillary Clinton? I'm so glad you aren't biased in giving the public information.

trump wins this one hands down. He made fact checking great again

Hillary Clinton is a very smart and intelligent presidential candidate, that nobody knows of,

Breaking Hillary exposed❌❌

Biased media doing anything they can to drag this crooked Hag Hillary across the Finish line! 

Was it over when the Germans bombed Pearl Harbor?!? 🇺🇸

Donald J Trump rocked this debate. Let's face the facts people. Clearly Donald J Trump cleaned Hillary Clinton's clock in tonight's debate. Hillary Clinton represents the past and truly is what is wrong with this country and Washington DC . She is the embodiment of the political status that has taken place for way to long here in America . Donald J Trump truly is what America needs at this time in American history.

Hillary got demolished tonight..... Exposed for the pathetic fraud she is

You are all entitled to your own opinions. However, you are not entitled to your own set of facts.

Judging from the comments on all sides of the spectrum facts don't matter much anymore

Checked the facts? 
You can't prove or disprove either. 

NYT full of crap as always.

So why is it that she doesn't spend her own money to be pres? I think it's been proven she is attached to strings and dances to the puppet master.

Of the two, physically at face value, Hillary is the face of America. She has the experience of governance as well as foriegn diplomacy as Secretary of State.

At the end it was 39,000!  Oh my! It keeps multiplying!

DONALD TRUMP KILLED AMERICAN JOBS..HE SENT THEM OVERSEAS !

This is really crappy journalism. No depth or analysis, and obvious bias.

Trump the great should win, not this canal minded clinton.

My  question is why are 23 of trumps quotes fact checked and only 5 of hillarys. That to me is a bias opinion.

Trump lies every time he opens his big racist sexist ignorant mouth 
Disgusted 😡

Why do you do most of the fact checking on Donald? Is that because Hilary didn't say anything?

Another night chuck full of lies for Donald. And menacing, looming behind her, making faces, pacing. He was so creepy.

LMAO Hillary grabbed Trump in the genitals and found he didn't have any.

Fact: Trump thinks ISIS is a woman, that's why he is infatuated with it.

Looool my neighbor 5 years old dog have better depth and knowledge than Trump.

So they both get a few things right and lie about others. Two sides of the same crappy coin.

SOME FACTS - BILL CLINTON IS A RAPIST..NO RAPISTS IN THE WHITE HOUSE PLEASE!

Thank you, NYT, for helping us keep facts in front of us

Gabriela Sanchez since u missed most of it here are some highlights baby. Te amo mi guera

Trump supporters won't read this perhaps due to the fact that there were too many big words used in this article.

Don't bother checking... facts don't seem to matter anymore. Some will just blame media.

The New York Times is pro Clinton so all of this is going to favor her 😂

Yikes, most "fact checks" are a joke and the NYT, a division of the Clinton campaign, tops the list.

The basic assumption of NY times is that their average reader is ignorant!

Fact: the NYT does not pay taxes. http://www.breitbart.com/big-journalism/2016/10/02/new-york-times-paid-no-taxes-2014/

I like how a lot of what Trump said is actually true but since this is a bias paper they are saying he's lying.

A must read. He lied or was deceptive on almost everything he said

He won it thumbs down , tell me who is a saint in politics , it's better to vote TRUMP cause you know who he is but Hilary is someone who is hiding behind an angel face so I wouldn't waste my vote on her

Hey Deplorables, if you don't trust the Times' fact-checking, DON'T READ IT. Don't comment on it. Easy enough.

We want to Go with fact do We Okay Let's Do that The United States was attacked Sept 11 During the George W Bush Republican Presidency with a Republican Senate in the House the economy fail jobs lost Wall Street fail all under the Republican Party Explain Why I,ll Wait

33,000 mails are a lot of spam .. Lol

Half of your fact checks are even wrong. Again. Biased.

The elusive mind of an idiot like Trump who has capability of hitting the red button of nuclear bombs if he is elected as the next president of the United States of America would pose existential threat to the whole world,thus Americans regardless of being Republican or Democratic voter must set all disagreements aside and strongly coalesce around Hilary Clinton and stave off a disaster, otherwise we-all must be waiting around for a darker than black situation.

Yes on both, the facts are common knowledge.

She will push to destroy the supreme court, increase the propaganda war against Russia to the point we go to WWIII On the wrong side of the battle. Increase immigration by a million Muslims in order to fulfill the Soros directive in order to cause insurrection and economic collapse. Response from citizens to fatwas called by the mosques to go to war will lead to fighting Islam door to door as Germans are coming close to doing. This will lead to implementation of the executive orders Obama has put in place for a federalized police state under United Nations control which is where Obama will probably go next. She will pass TPP which unites with the European trade agreements and agenda 21 and crisis response will lead to single payer under government control finishing up controlling all aspects of our lives. Civil war will lead to death beyond imagination, the Muslim Brotherhood controlled DHS has billions of rounds of ammunition. Patriots are already all over the Homeland security threat list. Most life needs resources will be controlled and used for control. The resistance will be overcome despotism will be the rule and despotism leads blind sheep to accept any shepherd.

22 fact checks on trump and 5 on Hillary? Seems just a tad bit biased...

DONALD TRUMP IS NOT THE BUSINESSMAN HE CLAIMS TO BE ~ Trump is not a “Genius” when it comes to taxes or business.  

“WHAT KIND OF GENIUS LOSES ALMOST A BILLION DOLLARS IN ONE YEAR”???

“HOW CAN ANYONE LOSE MONEY IN THE CASINO INDUSTRY”?

He is a crook who screwed our Nation and the American People:

Donald the business mogul may not have paid taxes for as many as 18 years after declaring a $916 million loss on his 1995 returns. A New York Times report late Saturday showed how Trump had used byzantine tax laws to cancel out income taxes after his real estate and casino empire nearly collapsed in the early 1990s, and the Times calculated that the resulting deductions may have allowed him to pay no federal income taxes for 18 years. “It’s gnawing on Trump that he could become what he has contempt for, and that is a loser.” The Times, which obtained Trump’s 1995 tax records, reported that Trump may have taken advantage of special rules for real estate investors that legally allowed him to use his $916 million loss to offset $50 million a year in future taxable income for as many as 18 years. “We see Donald Trump is having to defend the fact that he may not have paid taxes for 20 years, which is something most Americans don’t have the option to do,” “Trump is a billion-dollar loser who won’t release his taxes because they’ll expose him as a spoiled, rich brat who lost the millions he inherited from his father,” Reid said. He went on to call Trump “a racist, incompetent failure who managed to lose a billion dollars in a boom year.” 

Trump’s tax plan — which would cut rates for high-income people like him and eliminate the “carried interest” loophole that benefits hedge fund managers, among other things — does not address the rule he may have taken advantage of. He and his campaign have not yet said whether Trump plans to eliminate or change it. Central to Trump’s candidacy has been the idea of him as a successful businessman. Political analysts said the revelation that he declared a nearly $1 billion loss when his real estate company almost collapsed threatens to undercut his credibility in business. “People can look at this little bit of evidence and now question his business acumen,” Elleithee said. Secondly, he said, it is an example of Trump benefitting personally from a system he has railed against. “You’ve got the middle-class people working longer hours for low wages — they pay their taxes, they support their schools, they support their infrastructure, they support the military,” Sanders said. He added, “Trump goes around and says: ‘Hey, I’m worth billions! I’m a successful businessman! And I don’t pay any taxes. But you — you make 15 bucks an hour — you pay the taxes, not me.’” “The looming threat of the tax returns issue has always been that Trump’s refusal to disclose makes it look like he has something to hide and that, ultimately, any disclosure could blow a hole in his appeal to the average taxpayer. Well, the threat has now become a reality. “We are going to make America wealthy again,” Trump said ESPECIALLY ME!!! as he wrapped up another speech.

Sean Sullivan and Robert Costa contributed to this report.

6 Bankruptcies
Tax evasion.  Living off the backs of the poor and middle-class.  Living off those who work hard in this Country and pay their fair share of taxes.  Pay your taxes, but I don’t have to.
Bilking small business owners and stiffing contractors by not paying them what he owed.
Hillary has decades’ worth of her taxes online and actually pays taxes.  Trump doesn’t have any of his taxes online and pays no taxes.  Hillary contributes to our Infrastructure, Trump does not.

RECENT POLL NUMBERS SAY THAT 73% OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WANT TO SEE TRUMPS TAXES.

79% OF TRUMP’S SUPPORTERS BELIEVE IT’S TRUMP’S CIVIC DUTY TO PAY TAXES.

6 OUT OF 10 BELIEVE TRUMP IS HIDING SOMETHING.

REGARDLESS OF WHETHER OR NOT TRUMP IS UNDER AUDIT, HE CAN STILL RELEASE HIS TAXES.

WHAT IS HE HIDING?  TRUMPS SURROGATES, SAY “WHO CARES”?  THE MAJORITY OF AMERICAN PEOPLE CARE!

FORBES:  DONALD TRUMP IS NOT WORTH 10 BILLION, AS HE CLAIMED.  ONLY 3.6 BILLION, MAYBE..?

TRUMP CLAIMS HE IS AN EXPERT ON TAXES.  HE HAS A TEAM OF TAX LAWYERS AND ACCOUNTANTS THAT HANDLE HIS TAXES.

I am sure we can trust a "FACT" check by the NYTs...LOL...Hillary got CLOCKED in that debate- that's the ONLY fact I care about.

Thanks but facts dont matter to the deplorables. Sickened.

Fat - checking Sunday nights' brawl we find...
Donald was the fatter- looking one.

The bias in this article is ridiculous, but so was the debate and this election in general.

Why would any candidate say they were going to prosecute the other.

Hillary failed to point out NAFTA was not signed by Bill Clinton but GEORGE BUSH a month BEFORE Clinton took office. Let's give credit where credit is due !!!

I'd say, "way to go Hillary."if she did. I don't even know how to delete 2,165 emails! Lol!

NY Times is highly unreliable, anti-Trump, biased, and wrong.

Facts? What do they have to do with being a president?? Apparently we think that just like murder doesn't apply to war, libel and slander don't apply to political "discourse"

I was looking for facts... not subjective comments. "It's not that bad." Really? According to whom?

Your wish will be granted if Trump wins. Although, that'd be because the human race will be gone before the next election.

10 anti Trump posts..?
Must of hit a nerve with the Clinton Cartel and their media machine

I feel sorry for USA to be in hand of this Lunatic like trump it's the worse night mirror of planet hearth....

New York times can't be trusted to tell us the time, let alone fact checking anything. Zero credibility

He have no idea...He is just a joke .l feel sorry for American !! This clown

I really liked the format of this. Thanks for making all of this extremely important information easy to digest.

Answer me this, would you leave your beautiful daughter in a room alone with the Donald ???

The only thing Trupm is using against Hilary is her emails, over and over the same.

Why is the founder of al-Qaeda and Daesh or supports terrorist organizations

Because anyone should trust an extremely biased, left winged publication facts.

Did Hillary lie? Will Trump stop interrupting? Will a real debate occur? What moderators? ...Next time on Dragonball Z: America's Fxcked

READ THIS, you nincompoops who are actually thinking about voting for this monumental jerk.

Like the NYT Zwould be unbiased in your fact check! Hilarious! Best laugh this morning!!!

I hope Trump remembers that he can't save his own house by trying to set other people's houses on fire
Get Trump Nope T-Shirt : https://goo.gl/XrTTDL

Trump aligned himself with Russia, Assad and Iran tonight. That alone disqualifies him for me. #ImWithHer

To begin with ...replace this friendly grampa looking picture of trump with one more vampirish to reflect his true nature

your fact check about Hillary and open borders is wrong...this was in releases emails of Wikileaks !

How about we get a otoscope and look inside his nose to see if his septum is still intact(?)  "sniff."

Oh I'm sure you checked the facts alight. Then put forward your own spin.

This article is why journalism isn't credible and is going down the drain. Shame on u libral media, you're pathetic.

He's brought the National Inquirer  to the presidency.

Did Trump not have time to get his gray hair colored on the sides?

Isn't it NAFTA? It's an acronym, not a word. Ref UNICEF, AIDS, ERA. And RBI.

I will believe these fact checks when they come from a media source that is not biased

Like anyone believes a NYT 'fact check' would be unbiased. Nice try...

Yep and yep. and if you believe otherwise you might be the victim of misinformation.

Why are we still talking about this??why aren't we talking about how corporate lobbyists run Washington and have taken over?

How many of you who commented read the story? I'm a speed reader, and I just finished it.

Trump played his role as One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest with pride!!

Once you see through a person, nothing he can do to change your mind, he is done.

Everyone is mad because he punked out Hillary..lol..

Join the millions of Americans who REJECT the values of the Democrat and Republican party. No WikiLeaks. No Hot Mics. Not beholden to financial industry special interests. Gary Johnson is a former two-term Governor with a solid track record. Join us and join the next American Revolution. VOTE your values, VOTE Gary Johnson for President. #YouIn? #2016JohnsonWeld

HA -- NYT -- have you gotten in trouble yet for publishing an illegally received tax Return?  Are you going to admit you paid no taxes in 2014?  Are you AFRAID of the law being equally applied?

I can't even believe what you say because you're so partisan.

NAFTA also killed domestic trade in Mexico.

#JillSteinForPresident. True progressives can now vote our conscience for Jill Stein since #TrumpHasImploded.

Yes yes she hid things to save her butt and let Chris and 4 others died

A política americana se preocupa com adultérios e não com cemitérios das pessoas por não terem saúde pública, distribuição de renda, políticas públicas de inclusão social. O número de moradores de rua e desempregados só aumenta e os bilionários aplaudem e fomentam guerras e golpes em outros países.

The New York Times is a government sanctioned propaganda spewing corporate welfare taking corrupted organization. Has not told the truth about much since before 9/11/2001. Shameful. Never Hillary. Never Trump.

If you believe these facts? I have a spaceship to sell for $10 million!!! Any Dumbasses I mean takers?

just wondering why NYT is endorsing a candidate?? should it not be impartiall and informative??

Whoever wins, we as the outsiders would still celebrate.
For
Your
Fall
🍻

Really it's a fact she deleted emails even if it was 1 email deleted why won't the nyt goes after finding the context of those emails ???

CNN's >>scientifically modeled<< poll gives the 2nd debate to Clinton 57% to 34%. Actually, Trump beat himself -- all Clinton had to do was give him rope. Defensive, combative, and vague about his plans (and creepily stalking her around the stage), he appealed to nobody but his basket of deplorables. Finally, threatening to jail a political opponent was the coup de grâce -- repugnance worthy of a banana republic thug. Watch the press flambé him tomorrow and even more Republicans flee. He's toast.

No Daniel Blevins America does not stand with Trump. Speak for yourself only. All of us are not crazy as you are.

Go Madam President Hillary Clinton! You are the one!

I SHALL INCREASE THE STARS.

I express here that My candidacy to the U.S. presidential election in November 8 as an independent candidate.

My running mate is Keiichi Sakagami (My brother).

For the presidential election, Senate armed services committee (Mafia mccain family) doesn't have any authority.

About crazy interference of Mafia john mccain, it is just an ultra vires act (State Crime).

My nationality (Japan) matter is, US Citizen should determine it.

I am NOT a reserve of Mafia john mccain family. 
 I'm FREE.

My campaign pledges are Suppression of the IS, Al-Qaeda, Taliban and North korea.

Another pledges are the annexation of Canada, Mexico, and Bahamas.

The candidate who shows many policies such as the World reorganization, establishment of worldwide acquisition of resources, neighborhood territory acquisition, IS & Taliban extermination, Fiscal reconstruction, improvement in public peace and ID confirmation & gun tax, to the offer of various means of transportation specifically a linear motor car & the Shinkansen, and a fair progressive tax system, about the presidential election is only Me.

I already showed even several concrete military strategy cases (My note etc.).

An abstract slogan can see almost no concrete policy for a candidate for anyone but Me.

It's because itself is their final goal, to assume US president for very incompetent them.

Exchange of trying to obstruct other’s foot by a slur isn't very ashamed current state.

You must not supposed to choose the incompetent president who becomes a laughingstock of all over the world by shabby correspondence of an offshore oil field accident in the Gulf of Mexico.

The stupid president who is a shameless person with the name as "obama care" wouldn't disappear into the insurance system that his subordinate drafted forever as a stain of American history.

The most important element is how much HUGE outcome I achieved after the president assumption.

If we were elected, I would appoint Hillary to the VP.
 I also want to appoint Donald as a secretary of the Homeland Security.

Try Me.

He mopped the floor with her tonight

The NYT is bias as hell. FACT!

New York times and CNN are cheerleaders for Clinton.

Best line of the night ... Yea you'd be in jail ‼️

Love those Fact Checkers...TRUMP lies Constantly!!

Hillary!!!

go to KILLERYS site to fact check? What a joke

BS by NYT again!

This debate was terrible

A New York Times fact check, yeah that sounds reliable lol

PS Trump won the debate Hillary did horrible

Y'all need fact check your fact checker, Google is free @newYorktimes

Trump: corrupt and liar.

Those pesky facts.

There is no evidence because she DELETED THE EMAILS !!!! 📲🔨

dLOL, like we can trust the New York Times for the truth!

Misleading journalism, regardless of whom you support.

Biased nyt

New York Times is the worse newspaper out there

Facts are good.

She is definitely more truthful than him.

Doesn't look like there were many facts to check.

We can't get enough fact checks.

New York Times you are pathetic 🤓

He got maybe one answer correct.

So, basically, he said whatever he felt like saying?

Nice one sided article👍🏼👍🏼

Omg I am surprised that NYTimes is after trump for the first time 😱

We may need to start fact checking the NY Times...

Read the fact check - lies on lies by Trump!

Trump has some homework to do.

Check the facts

So then they are both liars. Nothing new in politics.

Point by point fact checked…

Fact check Trump

Whatever Trump said was all wrong.....

Interesting.

Facts DO matter you Orange Menace.

This is way too biased

All I can say is WOW!😣

Thank You!  #I'm with her

I would assume that all of us here would receive the same compassion, (from the DOJ) if we destroyed evidence after we had been subpoenaed.

The New York Times fact checking. That is awesome considering they keep Walter Duranty's Pulitzer for reporting on Russia famine, which is beyond proven he lied on behalf of Stalin.  The "mostly true" response to Clinton and Paula jones is comedy gold. The "read more" supports every point, but it's only mostly true.

Fact Check: NYT spins facts to push agenda. UNDENIABLE.

Yep

Even nyt lies like Hilary

How about wether or not he is putting his own 150 million dollars into the campaign? I thought he was Gina coming the campaign, which means he is paying himself back?  Fact check the call for her to put her own money in. I don't think his own money is staying in.

Years ago, Donald Trump coined the phrase "truthful hyperbole" to describe his endless prevaricating.  Over time, he has refined it to near-perfection--until the fact-checkers chime in.



Well glad we used NY Times to fact check-this paper has made it their goal to tear Trump down  for the last year-maybe someone should fact check them

Don the Con, he's only lying when his lips are moving.



Good luck, America. You're on your own.

Trump is a liar

Sorry NYT but you lie. Please pay your taxes!



Nafta was the dumbest move ever!



Lol bias media again

These see what you have fact checkers?

Dump Trump

Why bother?

Yeah....NAFTA was great for US ....please NYT......

How do you know when Don is lying ?
When his mouth is moving.

U know the truth but u hide it why??this is the big question

That's a good thing! He will clean your mess up!

Trump rewrites history to suit himself. He will be history in November

You're right no her and President Obama did

The people have got to realize that trump has given up a lavish private life to be ridiculed and mocked by the press because he loves this country and is tired of seeing it run into the gutter.  (L ( TRUMP 2016 )

Go Hillary!

You need to be fact checked we know the truth

This is in no way biased at all😂😂😂😂

Fact check: Trump obliterated her tonight.

Thank you for the facts. That's all that matters. FACTS.

NYT is a joke

The real litmus test is how we learn from mistakes.

Still on the fence...slightly leaning Trump or not voting at all.  It's about appointing judges at this point.  Also, I don't support wage depressing  open borders or free trade.

And they talk about her smile.

yes and yes

Those last two paragraphs. Wow!

Let's talk about the 55 million Bush emails that surround 9/11

False check you mean

NY Times please most corrupt rag on the market.

I'm Hillary supporter but I think we  should replace Hillary she's horrible. How can you lose to him after all the bs he said

Your bias is showing again, NYT.

Which facts?

Veteran's and small business owners for Trump🗽💪😍😎🗽

The media supports Clinton

I don't go for your fact check

He is insane! End of story!

YOURE ALL CORRUPT, and your judgement day will come

33,000 deleted email is just locker room talk period.

Nobody believes Ny time's anymore
🗽🗽🗽🗽🗽

Omg. The Clinton's PR department expects me to read and believe this. The NYT wouldn't know a fact if it fell on then.  Their facts are exactly what Hillary tells them.

I agree with you dave

GO TRUMP.

NY Times checking facts? Not an ounce of honesty to be found!

Trump said 33K then 39K.   If he can't keep it straight then who can?  He is an attention grabber not a debater and  that has shown through dramatically.  Trump can't be trust with the truth for most things.

#GaryJohnson2016

Hillary always tells the truth



#garyjohnson

Clinton = House of Cards ...

33,000 emails.. Dam

yes. yes.

Both are the worst presidential candidates!

How low can Bill and Hill go? ;) JGD. ----dr.

I HOPE MY DAUGHTER'S HAVE MORE SELF-ESTEEM AND SELF RESPECT TO DIVORCE A ABUSIVE HUSBAND! !!! God help us if she's president we will have no moral value

CROOKED DONALD TRUMP AND THE TRUMP CRIME FAMILY Spent more than a quarter-million dollars from his charitable foundation to settle lawsuits that involved the billionaire’s for-profit businesses, according to interviews and a review of legal documents.

Those cases, which together used $258,000 from Trump’s charity, were among four newly documented expenditures in which Trump may have violated laws against “self-dealing” — which prohibit nonprofit leaders from using charity money to benefit themselves or their businesses.

In one case, from 2007, Trump’s Mar-a-Lago Club faced $120,000 in unpaid fines from the town of Palm Beach, Fla., resulting from a dispute over the size of a flagpole.

In a settlement, Palm Beach agreed to waive those fines — if Trump’s club made a $100,000 donation to a specific charity for veterans. Instead, Trump sent a check from the Donald J. Trump Foundation, a charity funded almost entirely by other people’s money, according to tax records.

In another case, court papers say one of Trump’s golf courses in New York agreed to settle a lawsuit by making a donation to the plaintiff’s chosen charity. A $158,000 donation was made by the Trump Foundation, according to tax records.

According to the report, Trump used Trump Foundation money, that would be money that was donated by other people to his charitable foundation to do charitable stuff, to pay for debts owed by Trump's personal businesses. 

This, however, is in keeping with Trump using Trump Foundation money for a political donation to Florida's Attorney General and to buy a portrait of him for his personal use. These all are covered by the IRS regulations prohibiting "self-dealing" by charitable organizations.

New Information:  Trump asks those who owe him money to send it to his Trump Charity to avoid paying taxes on it.

UPDATE: TRUMP DOES NOT HAVE THE PROPER CERTIFICATION TO SOLICIT OUTSIDE DONORS!  ANYTHING OVER $25,000 REQUIRES AN AUDIT ACCORDING TO THE NEW YORK AG.  UH OH…..

TRUMP PAID $8.2 Million to Family Members/Businesses.  MONEY CAME FROM THOSE WHO CONTRIBUTE TO HIS CAMPAIGN.  (DONORS) 

TRUMP PROFITED $1.8 Million from Taxpayer Funded Secret Service.

TRUMP GETS $2.3 MILLION FROM COMEDY CENTRAL WHICH WENT INTO HIS CHARITY TO AVOID TAXES.  

DONALD TRUMP DOES NOT PAY HIS FAIR SHARE OF TAXES, BUT EXPECTS EVERYONE ELSE TO PAY THEIRS…THE SELF-PROCLAIMED BILLIONAIRE RIPS OFF HIS DONORS AND THE AMERICA PEOPLE….

NEWSWEEK: TRUMP VIOLATES THE CUBAN EMBARGO AND LIES TO CUBAN-AMERICANS IN SOUTH FLORIDA.

TRUMP PAYS NO TAXES AND HASN’T FOR DECADES.  CHEATS THE AMERICAN PEOPLE!  TRUMP CLAIMS HE WANTS TO FIX THE SYSTEM THAT HE HAS FAILED TO CONTRIBUTE TO… ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS, THE POOR AND MIDDLE-CLASS HAVE PAID MORE IN TAXES, THAN TRUMP!!!

Checking facts on deleted emails. .excuse us please. Emails about her daughters wedding. 33000 ! When will  she ever say the truth

Uncle Billy wants to know what all you ladies are doing after this debate.  He's hungry for his next victim.

LMAO!  your paper and posts are a thinking persons cocktail party joke.

In the past I would have read the fact checks.  However I know longer waste my time.  The media has lost the ability to report the facts.

Why didn't the NYT pick up Trump's lie about being endorsed by ICE.  He stated the very same lie in the 1st debate.  ICE can't endorse any candidate or party.  It's against federal law.

We are not electing a saint. We are electing someone with the guts to take back this country. Over the last 30 years it has been overrun by globalist working with the world Bankers to destroy sovereign nations and borders. Hundreds of thousands have died. We are now on the Brink of World War 3 because of a propaganda war against Russia and Assad. Ukraine did not want to sign onto the European trade agreements, the result was a coup in which the globalist Obama led. There is only one chance to take back this country. You have been lied to on a massive scale. Man's worse enemy is his ego that will always be used against him. The media run by only 6 major groups is fully involved. They have lost all credibility removing the facade in their attempt to take down Trump who will expose the lies of regime changes around the world and the collusion with the Clinton Foundation regime change machine that is a giant octopus with tentacles through out the government Banking Industry, foreign hostile governments and media...yes conspiracy is real wake up! If you do not you will wake up without a Constitution. 

The media and Hillary dropped the Billy Bush video on Trump which they had prepared, in order to take the focus off the Wikileaks email release on Goldman Sachs speeches speeches that prove Hillary will pass TPP and so so much more.

I am not voting for Trump because he says stupid stuff or I have a false since of his life,  I am voting for Trump to save our Constitution.

"  Hillary Clinton Said Her Dream Is A Hemispheric Common Market, With Open Trade And Open Markets. *“My dream is a hemispheric common market, with open trade and open borders, some time in the future with energy that is as green and sustainable as we can get it, powering growth and opportunity for every person in the hemisphere.” [05162013 Remarks to Banco Itau.doc, p. 28] *Hillary Clinton Said We Have To Have A Concerted Plan To Increase Trade; We Have To Resist Protectionism And Other Kinds Of Barriers To Trade. *“Secondly, I think we have to have a concerted plan to increase trade already under the current circumstances, you know, that Inter-American Development Bank figure is pretty surprising. There is so much more we can do, there is a lot of low hanging fruit but businesses on both sides have to make it a priority and it's not for governments to do but governments can either make it easy or make it hard and we have to resist, protectionism, other kinds of barriers to market access and to trade and I would like to see this get much more attention and be not just a policy for a year under president X or president Y but a consistent one.” [05162013 Remarks to Banco Itau.doc, p. 32]"

3.	While refusing to release your tax returns, how will you confirm that you do not have dangerous financial ties to bad actors abroad?

4.	If you were willing to work with Qaddafi—a known terrorist and dictator—is there anyone you aren't willing to make a deal with? Who?

5.	How can you be tough on Iran, given your business partnership with someone connected to Iranian money laundering? 

6.	Given that you've already questioned our commitments to NATO allies, what is your answer to this? For example, how would you handle the millions of dollars flowing into your organization from your Istanbul properties.

7.	To what extent would your foreign policy be dictated by potential financial benefits for your business partners? 

8.	Will you disclose the nature of your personal and business relationships with all of the Russian oligarchs you are “close” to?

9.	Have you or your campaign discussed U.S.-Russian relations with the Russian billionaires with whom you've done business?

10.	 How did the Russian mob boss who ran a criminal organization out of Trump Tower get a VIP pass to your Miss Universe pageant in Moscow?

11.	With business ties to politically-connected Indian developers, how can you conduct foreign policy that puts the U.S. above your profits?

12.	How can we be sure you'd be willing to be tough on any nation if necessary, if it would put your interests and profits at risk?

13.	How can we know you won't (again) impulsively damage relationships with crucial allies to preserve your own ego? 

14.	We know you engaged extensively in pay-to-play here at home. Have you bribed foreign officials or other parties abroad?

15.	To what extent are you and your family currently contractually tied to payments from foreign business partners, or governments?

16.	You've mentioned ~120 foreign deals, including in countries with national security implications. Where and with whom are you working?

17.	Will your children disclose all of the foreign trips and business deals they've undertaken during the campaign, and with whom they met?

18.	In sum, how will Trump guarantee that if forced to choose between America's security and his own bank account, he won't pick the latter?

19.	It's pretty clear: Trump's spent his life unscrupulously looking out for his own wallet above all. Why would that change as president?

20.	If elected, will Trump and his family sever ties to the Trump organization?

DONALD TRUMP HAS HUGE FINANCIAL TIES TO NUMEROUS FOREIGN COUNTRIES, TIED TO HIS BUSINESSES AROUND THE WORLD…..RUSSIA, CHINA, SAUDI ARABIA, IRAN AND THAT’S JUST FOR STARTERS….(IN A RECENT ARTICLE BY KURT EICHENWALD ON NEWSWEEK), HIS TIES TO THESE COUNTRIES WOULD BE A CONFLICT OF INTEREST WHEN IT COMES TO “NATIONAL SECURITY”!
