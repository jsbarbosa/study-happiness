I'm not an expert in nature reading but what I concluded after watching debate is that ""Trump is an honest straight forward person and Hillary a liar and a fake old lady with arrogant eyes ""

"Actions speak louder than words. Mr. Trump might have said some bad words, but Bill Clinton raped me. And Hillary Clinton threatened me. I dont think there's any comparison." -Jaunita Broderick, Bill Clinton rape survivor. Hillary Clinton supporters, especially women, how utterly SHAMEFUL you are.

People, please explain why it is necessary to have a political cat fight in the comment section of this article. The New York Times why don't you delete these irrelevant posts?

They let children run things behind the scenes?Or should that refer to a grown woman, not a girl?

wow, the new york times actually made a post without saying something negative about trump.  im so proud of you, new york times!  good for you! :)
